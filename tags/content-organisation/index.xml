Some of the improvements I want to make are:
Moving content articles from a flat structure to a leaf bundle Rename content section to blog from posts Upgrading hugo-coder theme and hugo version Adding a table of contents to the pages &amp;hellip; and further improvements as I find them This post will cover items 1-2, the others will be in a follow up post.</description></item></channel></rss>
