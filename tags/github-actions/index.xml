In this post we will look at how we can migrate from TravisCI to GitHub Actions, GitHub&amp;rsquo;s own CI/CD tool.
This post will also be useful if you are looking to onboard GitHub Actions as your CI/CD pipeline! ðŸš€

In part 2 we modified it slightly to include the CNAME file post-build to ensure GitHub Pages uses the custom domain we set up in that same part.
For this part, I will tell you about how I migrated from deploying via a script, to a CI/CD tool - namely TravisCI.</description></item></channel></rss>
