&lt;p>This site will be an area for me to braindump everything and anything that comes across my mind - although I&amp;rsquo;ll try my best to keep it tech-focused!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The blog platform itself is pretty basic. It is built using &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a>, hosted using &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages&lt;/a>, while served over a custom domain via CloudFlare. While this isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly anything to brag about, it is only meant to be a quick and easy platform to spin up and get hosted so that I can focus on what really matters&amp;hellip; the content!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It also gives me an opportunity to migrate the platform from GitHub Pages onto another hosted platform. Maybe that is AWS, which is a perfect learning opportunity, or even customise the theme of this blog (which is very cool already - thanks &lt;a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-coder/">hugo-coder!&lt;/a>) that I have left as its default. All of which provides me with more content to blog about!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See you around!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
