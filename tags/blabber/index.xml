      <description>&lt;p&gt;Howdy! ðŸ‘‹&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site will be an area for me to braindump everything and anything that comes across my mind - although I&amp;rsquo;ll try my best to keep it tech-focused!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog platform itself is pretty basic. It is built using &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, hosted using &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;, while served over a custom domain via CloudFlare. While this isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly anything to brag about, it is only meant to be a quick and easy platform to spin up and get hosted so that I can focus on what really matters&amp;hellip; the content!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also gives me an opportunity to migrate the platform from GitHub Pages onto another hosted platform. Maybe that is AWS, which is a perfect learning opportunity, or even customise the theme of this blog (which is very cool already - thanks &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-coder/&#34;&gt;hugo-coder!&lt;/a&gt;) that I have left as its default. All of which provides me with more content to blog about!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you around!&lt;/p&gt;
