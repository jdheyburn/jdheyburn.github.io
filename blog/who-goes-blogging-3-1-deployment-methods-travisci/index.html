In <a href=https://jdheyburn.co.uk/posts/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/>part 2</a> we modified it slightly to include the <code>CNAME</code> file post-build to ensure GitHub Pages uses the custom domain we set up in that same part.</p><p>For this part, I will tell you about how I migrated from deploying via a script, to a CI/CD tool - namely <a href=https://travis-ci.com/>TravisCI</a>. Then I will document how I migrated from this, to the new <a href=https://github.com/features/actions>GitHub Actions</a>; GitHub&rsquo;s offering into the CI/CD space.</p><blockquote><p><code>CI/CD</code> is an acronym for Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment which is a very important concept in the DevOps culture.

Whereas the next post will focus on migrating to, and setting up GitHub Actions. If you&rsquo;re only interested in using that as your CI tool then I&rsquo;ll provide a link to that here when it is posted.</p><h1 id=moving-away-from-deploy-sh>Moving Away From deploy.sh</h1><p>There&rsquo;s nothing necessarily wrong with using <code>deploy.sh</code> to push our code, however we want to get all the bells and whistles that Continuous Integration can provide to us such as running a series of tests and checks automatically against every commit to our repository. Once those tests and checks pass then we can automate the deployment of our website.</p><p>Now there are many CI tools out there with the most well known likely to be <a href=https://jenkins.io/>Jenkins</a>, but there are also hosted solutions available which will take your code and perform your pipelines against them.</p><p>One of those hosted solutions is <a href=https://travis-ci.com/>TravisCI</a>, where they integrate quite nicely with GitHub repositories to attach <a href=https://developer.github.com/webhooks/>webhooks</a> against them. They have several pricing options available, but for public open source projects, it is completely free!</p><p>So it is a good idea to set your source code repository on GitHub to be public. TravisCI does include (at the time of writing) private projects in their free plan, but you are capped in some shape or form on how much the platform will do for you.</p><figure><img src=travis-free.png alt="Screenshot of Travis free pricing plan"><figcaption><p>Free is definitely a thing you love to see</p></figcaption></figure><h1 id=travisci-account-setup>TravisCI Account Setup</h1><p>The TravisCI account setup for TravisCI is very streamlined - instead of creating <em>another</em> account for you to manage, it integrates in with GitHub, so this is the account you use to sign-up with. Head over to <a href=https://travis-ci.com/>https://travis-ci.com/</a> and click on <code>Sign in with GitHub</code>.</p><figure><img src=travis-landing.png alt="Screenshot of Travis landing page"><figcaption><p>You can&rsquo;t resist a big green button&hellip;</p></figcaption></figure><p>GitHub will ask you if you <em>really</em> want to share some of your GitHub data with Travis.</p><p><center><figure><img src=travis-github-authorise.png alt="Screenshot of GitHub authorising Travis"><figcaption><p>Another green button? Why not!</p></figcaption></figure></center></p><p>Once you&rsquo;ve done that, you&rsquo;ll be redirected to your new Travis Dashboard which&hellip; is looking rather lonely ðŸ˜¦
- let&rsquo;s fix that!</p><p>All we&rsquo;ve done so far is allowed Travis to reach GitHub for creating an account for us - we now need to activate GitHub Apps integration to permit it to read and write to our repositories. The <a href=https://travis-ci.com/account/repositories>https://travis-ci.com/account/repositories</a> page is what you need for that - then click on the <code>Activate</code> button.</p><figure><img src=travis-github-apps-integration.png alt="Screenshot of GitHub Apps Integration"><figcaption><p>&hellip;More green buttons?!</p></figcaption></figure><p>Now on the next screen you may or may not want the default selection of <code>All repositories</code> which will give Travis read and write access to all your repos. I completely trust Travis if I were to select this, however it is a best practice to follow the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege><em>principle of least privilege</em></a> (POLP); not just for users but for services too.</p><p>For the scope of this effort we&rsquo;re only wanting Travis to read and manipulate against two repos, <code>jdheyburn.co.uk</code> and <code>jdheyburn.github.io</code> - it also gives you a cleaner Travis dashboard too.</p><p><center><figure><img src=travis-github-repos-selection.png alt="Screenshot of GitHub Travis Repository Authorisation"></figure></center></p><h2 id=back-to-github>Back to GitHub</h2><p>The next step is required to permit Travis to push the built project to our GitHub Pages repo. We need to generate a secret with the permissions that Travis requires and keep it aside for the Travis config file later.</p><p>Navigate to the <a href=https://github.com/settings/tokens>GitHub Personal Access Tokens</a> page and click on <code>Generate new token</code>.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll come across a page asking for the name of the token being created. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you call it, but it may be useful to link it back to what it is being used for. You&rsquo;re also going to want to select the <code>repo</code> checkbox as done so below.</p><p>After this you don&rsquo;t need to provide any more permissions to the token. Scroll down to the end of the page and click <code>Generate token</code>.</p><p><center><figure><img src=travis-github-pat.png alt="Screenshot of GitHub Personal Access Token Creation - repos is checked"></figure></center></p><p>The token&rsquo;s secret will display on the next screen. <strong>Make sure you copy it</strong> and place it somewhere you can refer back to it later such as a text editor like Notepad - we&rsquo;ll need it again in the next section.</p><p><center><figure><img src=travis-github-pat-created.png alt="Screenshot of GitHub Personal Access Token Creation - token complete"></figure></center></p><h1 id=travisci-configuration>TravisCI Configuration</h1><p>Once we have our Travis account set up, we need to add in a <a href=https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/>configuration file</a> that Travis will read from to determine what steps we&rsquo;d like it to perform.</p><p>In our source code repository (<code>jdheyburn.co.uk</code> in my case) we want to create a file at the root directory and call it <code>.travis.yml</code>. See below for an example of how I configured mine.</p><script type=application/javascript src=https://gist.github.com/jdheyburn/073bd6d4cb9284774e7e7feee093d86f.js></script><p>Let&rsquo;s break it down section by section.</p><h2 id=build-environment>Build Environment</h2><p>These settings here all refer to the build environment that we&rsquo;d like our project to build on.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-yml data-lang=yml>dist:<span style=color:#666> </span>xenial<span style=color:#666>

In this case <code>xenial</code> refers to Ubuntu 16.04, which is a Linux distribution. There are <a href=https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/overview/>several others</a> to choose from and more likely than not you&rsquo;ll want the platform to be Linux. However if you had a Windows application written in <code>.NET</code> then you would likely want it built on a Windows Server since that is what supports it.</p><p><code>git.depth</code> tells Travis how many commits of your project to check out. This is passed directory to the <code>git</code> parameter <code>--depth</code> (more info on that <a href=https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone>here</a>). For our use case we&rsquo;re not interested in this option so we set it to <code>false</code> to disable the flag being passed to <code>git</code>.</p><p><code>env.global</code> allows us to define what variables should be set in the environment. This is done in the form of an array of strings in the format <code>key=value</code>. So given the example, <code>HUGO_VERSION</code> will be set to <code>0.58.3</code>. We&rsquo;ll come back to this later.</p><p><code>env.matrix</code> is the encrypted value that gets passed to the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> environment variable which is used to allow Travis to commit the built project to our GitHub Pages repo.
- You&rsquo;re going to want to take the personal access token generated from GitHub in the earlier step and encrypt it using <a href=https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables#encrypting-environment-variables>this method</a>, then add it back to this setting</p><h2 id=external-dependencies>External Dependencies</h2><p>Once the build environment is defined, we can tell Travis to pull in some additional dependencies or files required for our project. Now remember this is a <code>hugo</code> project and we needed to install it on our local machines to run <code>deploy.sh</code>, we need to do the same for Travis too.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-yml data-lang=yml>install:<span style=color:#666>

This is where it is called back again. In order, the steps we&rsquo;re performing are:</p><ol><li>Downloading the archive containing the specified <code>hugo</code> version</li><li>Extracting all contents of the archive</li><li>Moving the <code>hugo</code> binary to the <code>~/bin/</code> directory<ul><li>This directory is on the build servers <code>PATH</code>, which enables us to execute the binary using just the <code>hugo</code> command later</li></ul></li></ol><h3 id=previous-issues>Previous Issues</h3><p>In a previous version of <code>hugo</code> I used, there was an additional dependency I needed to include. The <code>hugo-coder</code> theme requires to be built with Hugo Extended since it requires Sass/SCSS support.</p><p>For this particular Hugo Extended version, it required a library which was not included in the build server distribution in the past. On the plus side - Travis allows us to define additional build steps to ensure all required libraries are on the build server beforehand.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-yml data-lang=yml>before_install:<span style=color:#666>

However this may come in handy later knowing that you have the option of specifying more pipeline steps if the build distribution you&rsquo;re using requires some additional dependencies.</p><h2 id=build-script>Build Script</h2><p>Now onto the juicy stuff - building the project. This is pretty much where the <code>deploy.sh</code> starts from, since on our local machines we already had the <code>hugo</code> binary installed.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-yml data-lang=yml>script:<span style=color:#666>

These weren&rsquo;t defined in the <code>deploy.sh</code> script we used earlier so let&rsquo;s cover them here.<ul><li><code>--gc</code> tells <code>hugo</code> to cleanup some unused cache files after the build<ul><li>This helps keep a tidy environment for the build server.</li></ul></li><li><code>--minify</code> performs <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)>minification</a> on your website to reduce the size of the generated content, enabling it to load faster on your users&rsquo; devices<ul><li>Coupled with a CDN like in the <a href=https://jdheyburn.co.uk/posts/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/#adding-our-cdn-layer>previous part</a>, your website will load almost instantly</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Copy the <code>CNAME</code> file from the project root to the generated <code>public/</code> directory.</p></li></ol><p>This ensures that the custom domain name we set up in the previous part continues to be set in the generated website code that gets pushed to our GitHub Pages repo. <a href=https://jdheyburn.co.uk/posts/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/#building-into-our-deploy-script>See here</a> for a refresher.</p><blockquote><p>This section is effectively the &lsquo;CI&rsquo; part of &lsquo;CI/CD&rsquo;.

Travis has <a href=https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/>good documentation</a> on this.

git push</code></pre></div><p>Travis will automatically detect that a new change has been made against your repo. And with the inclusion of <code>.travis.yml</code>, it will now work against that file.</p><p>You can view the status of your repository&rsquo;s build by navigating to it from the <a href=https://travis-ci.com/dashboard>dashboard</a> and clicking on it.</p><p>If any of the commands in the <code>script</code> section of the config return a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status#Shell_and_scripts>nonzero status code</a>, the build will fail. If this happens then have a look at a build log and investigate the issue. More likely than not someone else has encountered the problem before, so Google is your gatekeeper to solutions!</p><p>Once you&rsquo;ve got a successful build, that means your website has been deployed to the GitHub Pages repo and will be available on the web to view. In a browser you can now view your changes on the website.</p><p>If they aren&rsquo;t there then your browser is most likely caching an older version. By default, websites served by GitHub Pages have a browser cache TTL <a href=https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/119286/caching-assets-in-website-served-from-github-pages>set to 10 minutes</a>. So you can either wait 10 minutes, or clear your browser cache!</p><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1><p>You&rsquo;re on the way to DevOps masterclass. As mentioned the next post will focus on migrating to GitHub Actions so if you&rsquo;re happy with TravisCI then there&rsquo;s no more you need to do!
