The bigger picture of which I&amp;rsquo;ll write about in a future post. But for now, I came across some challenges with running &lt;a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy 2&lt;/a> as a reverse proxy for multiple domains used internally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled across this looking for the end config file for Caddy, then you can &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/reverse-proxy-multiple-domains-using-caddy-2/#caddy-configuration">skip there&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="background">Background&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A few months back I kitted out my home with some &lt;a href="https://www.ui.com/products/#unifi">Ubiquiti UniFi&lt;/a> gear to fix our crappy Wifi at home, following inspiration from &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/ubiquiti-all-the-things-how-i-finally-fixed-my-dodgy-wifi/">Troy Hunt&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/my-ubiquiti-home-network/">Scott Helme&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to administrate UniFi devices, you&amp;rsquo;ll need the &lt;a href="https://www.ui.com/unifi/unifi-cloud-key/">UniFi Cloud Key&lt;/a> which runs the Controller software to do just that. Although if you have a spare Raspberry Pi lying around, you can download the &lt;a href="https://www.ui.com/download/unifi/">software&lt;/a> for free and run it on there - this is what I did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve also wanted to protect my home network with a self-hosted DNS server, such as &lt;a href="https://pi-hole.net/">PiHole&lt;/a>. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into depth about how that was done, but you can follow &lt;a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/securing-dns-across-all-of-my-devices-with-pihole-dns-over-https-1-1-1-1/">Scott Helme&amp;rsquo;s guide&lt;/a> on how you can set the same up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both of these services can be accessed through web browsers at the IP address and ports where they are being hosted, such as &lt;code>http://192.168.1.10:8093/admin/&lt;/code> in the case of PiHole. Having to remember the IP address and the port can be a pain. We can front these services with a rememberable domain name which points to these services - of which I&amp;rsquo;ve written about in a &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/">previous post&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="securing-with-https">Securing with HTTPS&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The web is evolving, and there is no reason why we should access services via insecure HTTP, that includes services that are only running on an internal network such as a home network. Web browsers nowadays give you a warning when you are connecting to website over an unencrypted connection.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">&lt;a href="insecure-pihole.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/reverse-proxy-multiple-domains-using-caddy-2/insecure-pihole.png"
alt="Insecure PiHole connection"/> &lt;/a>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Simply accessing over HTTP is not an option, when browsers present us with a huge warning message&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy&lt;/a> is a web server similar to Apache, nginx, et al., but it is different in that it enables HTTPS by default and upgrades requests from HTTP to HTTPS. Managing certificates for HTTPS is a pain - so Caddy does that too, so long as you can prove you own the domain you are hosting requests at. We can use Caddy in a reverse proxy mode, allowing us to access services at endpoints such as &lt;code>https://pihole.domain.local&lt;/code> in our browsers and forward them to the corresponding IP address hosting the service.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/">reverse proxy&lt;/a> is a service that simply forwards client requests onto the server on the clients behalf.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="proving-domain-ownership">Proving Domain Ownership&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Caddy uses &lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt&lt;/a> (LE) to provide certificates for domains. Since domains can be exposed publicly, we will have to prove ownership of the domain to have LE issue certificates on our behalf - so we&amp;rsquo;ll have to purchase the domain from a registrar. I talked about how to do this for this website &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/#acquire-a-domain">in the past&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>LE supports several &lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/">challenge methods&lt;/a> in order to prove you own the domain. This helps mitigates attacks by adversaries by claiming they own a domain such as &lt;code>natwest.co.uk&lt;/code> - allowing them to create phishing attacks and steal banking information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since my network is only visible internally for the moment (i.e. the domain will only resolve to an IP address on my network) - I cannot use HTTP or TLS since these require the domain to resolve to a public IP address to a web server hosting a challenge file requested by LE. Therefore the only option I have is DNS challenge, where a randomly string generated by LE is placed into the &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-txt-record/">TXT record&lt;/a> of a DNS record to confirm ownership.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="building-our-caddy">Building Our Caddy&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For this exercise I&amp;rsquo;ll be using the latest version, Caddy 2, which allows for plugins to be built into the binary depending on your use case - including &lt;a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https#dns-challenge">DNS challenge&lt;/a>. This plugin isn&amp;rsquo;t included by default, so we&amp;rsquo;ll need to build our own Caddy binary. The tool to do this is called &lt;a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy">xcaddy&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>To build using xcaddy, you need to make sure you have &lt;a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">Go installed&lt;/a> on your machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Note that I am building Caddy on my laptop, but running it on a Pi, so I will have to specify the architecture that Pi is running on so that Go can correctly build it.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#6272a4"># Download xcaddy&lt;/span>
go get -u github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy/cmd/xcaddy

&lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">GOOS&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span>linux &lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">GOARCH&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span>arm &lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">GOARM&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">7&lt;/span> xcaddy build --with github.com/caddy-dns/cloudflare
&lt;span style="color:#6272a4"># Copy the new binary across to the Pi&lt;/span>
scp caddy pi:/home/pi/caddy/
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="caddy-configuration">Caddy Configuration&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The configuration I&amp;rsquo;m using can be seen below. Some things to note:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m using Cloudflare as the DNS name servers for the domain, even though I purchased my domain from namecheap
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This repeats an &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/#adding-our-cdn-layer">exercise I&amp;rsquo;ve done previously&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;ve done this for two reasons:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Caddy at the time of writing does not have a namecheap DNS challenge plugin&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s a proven method I know already&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A &lt;code>CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN&lt;/code> is required to have Caddy set the TXT record DNS challenge received from LE
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200167836-Managing-API-Tokens-and-Keys">Guide for the same&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Caddy is reverse proxying traffic to services running locally on the Pi&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Caddy is not verifying the certificate being hosted by the UniFi Controller (&lt;code>insecure_skip_verify = true&lt;/code>)
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The controller self-signs a certificate, and the reverse proxy has no means of establishing a chain of trust to verify the certificate&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s not a best practice to not verify the chain of trust, however I&amp;rsquo;m happy to accept the risk for now&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/">Click here&lt;/a> to see documentation on Caddy JSON config files.&lt;/p>
&lt;script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/jdheyburn/ca668a9d162535ab92db2cfa6f4e4e54.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;h2 id="updating-dns-records">Updating DNS Records&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Remember that the domain names aren&amp;rsquo;t actually publicly accessible. At a basic level we can update the &lt;code>/etc/hosts&lt;/code> file of the machine we&amp;rsquo;re running on to add a record telling our machine how to resolve the domain.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo sh -c &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;echo \&amp;#34;192.168.1.10 pihole.joannet.casa\n192.168.1.10 unifi.joannet.casa\&amp;#34; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/hosts&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>However, we&amp;rsquo;re already using PiHole as our own DNS server right? We can add the records there instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">&lt;a href="pihole-dns-records.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/reverse-proxy-multiple-domains-using-caddy-2/pihole-dns-records.png"
alt="Adding domain records to DNS server"/> &lt;/a>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>PiHole let&amp;rsquo;s you specify where local domain names should resolve to&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The IP addresses you see above are pointing to the host running Caddy, the Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="verifying-caddy">Verifying Caddy&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Once the config file is built, you can perform a test run to confirm everything is working by executing this command.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo ./caddy run --config config.json
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We need to execute using &lt;code>sudo&lt;/code> so that we can expose the service to restricted ports 80 and 443 (HTTP and HTTPS respectively).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;figure class="center">&lt;a href="proxied-pihole.png">

&lt;/figure>

alt="UniFi Controller appearing in browser through a domain name"/> &lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Now we have a memorable domain name fronting the service, and Firefox is happy that we&amp;rsquo;re encrypting the connection too. The certificate being produced in seen below.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">&lt;a href="pihole-certificate.png">

&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="enabling-caddy-service">Enabling Caddy Service&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Since we&amp;rsquo;re not using the standard Caddy installation method, we will need to specify a service unit file so that Caddy starts up at the same time as the host - which is what PiHole and UniFi are doing currently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First check to see if there is a stale service there already.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ ls -la /etc/systemd/system/caddy.service
lrwxrwxrwx &lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">1&lt;/span> root root &lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">9&lt;/span> Jun &lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">4&lt;/span> 09:14 /etc/systemd/system/caddy.service -&amp;gt; /dev/null
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If you get the above then remove the symlink so that we can create a file there.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">rm /etc/systemd/system/caddy.service
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Then populate the same file with the below, remembering the change the location of the Caddy config file to where it exists on your machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">[&lt;/span>Unit&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">]&lt;/span>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Finalise the new service with the two commands, enabling it on host startup and starting the service right now.&lt;/p>

sudo systemctl start caddy.service
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For now I have all the above running bare-metal on one Pi instance, which produces a huge single point of failure in my network. In the future I&amp;rsquo;d like to see how converting these to Docker containers and having them distributed on multiple Pis would increase the resiliency of these services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Until then, these basic but essential services are being hosted at easy to remember domains, transported over an encrypted connection, for me to easily administer the network for when it gets more complex over time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Who Goes Blogging 6: Three Steps to Improve Hugo's RSS Feeds</title><enclosure url="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-6-three-steps-to-improve-hugos-rss-feeds/cover.png" type="image/jpg"/><link>https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-6-three-steps-to-improve-hugos-rss-feeds/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-6-three-steps-to-improve-hugos-rss-feeds/</guid><description>&lt;p>I &amp;ldquo;fixed&amp;rdquo; the default RSS template used by Hugo to show the full article content, along with images, and also talk about how to have social media cards appear in the RSS items too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I uploaded my completed RSS file to &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/jdheyburn/a0a2c678f8f9795088b2779ec6af9920">GitHub Gist&lt;/a> 🚀&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-rss">What is RSS?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS&lt;/a> is a great way to &amp;ldquo;subscribe&amp;rdquo; to websites to ensure that you don&amp;rsquo;t miss content from them. The standard for how it is generated has been the same for decades now - however its still the best supported and most accepted way to receive updates. It is simply a standardised XML file that allows consumers such as RSS aggregators to parse the content of the post - for which there are many to choose from (RIP &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader">Google Reader&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">&lt;a href="inoreader-complete.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-6-three-steps-to-improve-hugos-rss-feeds/inoreader-complete.png"
alt="inoreader as an RSS feed aggregator"/> &lt;/a>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>My RSS aggregator of choice currently is &lt;a href="https://www.inoreader.com/">inoreader&lt;/a> - I&amp;rsquo;ll be using this in my examples&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Hugo &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">generates RSS XML&lt;/a> files from a template that will loop over your content and expose this at an endpoint for RSS aggregators to subscribe to and periodically check for updates against. Hugo generates a bunch of RSS XML files at different sections of the website, allowing consumers to subscribe to the section that interests them most - you can even subscribe to tags if that XML is being generated!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usually there is site top-level available at &lt;code>/index.xml&lt;/code> - in the case of my site that would be &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/index.xml">https://jdheyburn.co.uk/index.xml&lt;/a>. The source code for the template file Hugo uses to generate this is embedded in Hugo at &lt;a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/tpl/tplimpl/embedded/templates/_default/rss.xml">this location&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-problem">The Problem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Some (but not all) websites only include the first paragraph of their post in an RSS update (aka summary), along with a message after that paragraph requesting the reader to visit the site in a browser to view the rest of the content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a common feature of WordPress blogs - and it is done to have you load the full website and along with it, all the code for providing the owner with user analytics, and advertising - if they have it. So really they&amp;rsquo;re getting the benefit of being able to publish updates via a standardised approach (RSS), to then lure you onto the website.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">&lt;a href="rss-post-show-more-content.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-6-three-steps-to-improve-hugos-rss-feeds/rss-post-show-more-content.png"
alt="An RSS post loading incompletely"/> &lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Hugo &lt;em>kind of&lt;/em> does this through the highlighted line in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/tpl/tplimpl/embedded/templates/_default/rss.xml">templated RSS XML file&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">&amp;lt;description&amp;gt;&lt;/span>{{ .Summary | html }}&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">&amp;lt;/description&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>&lt;code>.Summary&lt;/code> will do what was just described, print out the first paragraph of your post. However unlike WordPress, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually say if there is more content. So users may not load your full website, instead thinking you&amp;rsquo;ve produced a very short article!&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">&lt;a href="hugo-incomplete-post.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-6-three-steps-to-improve-hugos-rss-feeds/hugo-incomplete-post.png"
alt="Hugo producing a summarised RSS post"/> &lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not against the practice of previewing the post, if a blog provides revenue for the author(s) then you will need to force readers to view the full website for analytics and advertising (businesses gotta make money!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although I&amp;rsquo;m sure the initial purpose of RSS was only meant to be used to provide subscribers a pure text version of your content. At the end of the day, I believe the author should give the reader choice on mediums of consumption - and they accept the limitations that come from RSS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now, I&amp;rsquo;ll be making several changes to the Hugo template RSS XML file to produce the full site content, along with some other enhancements.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="rendering-full-site-content">Rendering Full Site Content&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before we start editing files, we need to produce our own copy of the template RSS XML file. This is embedded directly within Hugo itself and not packaged in with your theme.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s every chance your theme is generating one for you. Run the below command to see if there is anything for you to copy from.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">find themes/ -type f -name &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#39;*.xml&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve discussed template lookup orders before in &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-5-updates-galore/#template-lookup-order-primer">previous posts&lt;/a> - we can overwrite the default of any file used in generating the website by placing it in your local project root.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can start to make modifications to the &lt;code>rss.xml&lt;/code> file by copying the &lt;a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/tpl/tplimpl/embedded/templates/_default/rss.xml">default&lt;/a> into the directory where Hugo will read it from.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#6272a4"># Assuming you are in project root&lt;/span>
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gohugoio/hugo/master/tpl/tplimpl/embedded/templates/_default/rss.xml -O layouts/_default/rss.xml

&lt;p>We can now see much more content is being produced - and with proper HTML this time!&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="rendering-images-in-rss-posts">Rendering images in RSS posts&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Depending on how you are retrieving images - you may find that they are not displaying, and that the image alterative (&lt;code>alt&lt;/code>) text is being displayed instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">&lt;a href="hugo-missing-images-post.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-6-three-steps-to-improve-hugos-rss-feeds/hugo-missing-images-post.png"
alt="Hugo RSS post with missing images, alt text displayed instead"/> &lt;/a>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Note the highlighted alt texts of images&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re not already providing an &lt;code>alt&lt;/code> field to your &lt;code>&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code> blocks then &lt;strong>you absolutely need to&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They help boost accessibility to your website should the user have a text-to-voice application reading your website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They also provide a helpful description to your image in case it cannot load - which happens more often than you think!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="why-it-is-breaking-">Why it is breaking 😤&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-4-content-structure-and-refactoring/">part 4&lt;/a> of this series, we looked at placing resources for a post in the same directory as the content markdown file (also known as &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/#leaf-bundles">leaf bundles&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That means for a given directory tree structure:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ tree content/blog
content/blog
└── some-blog-post
├── image-file-name.png
└── index.md
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>We would use the following shortcode to generate the &lt;code>&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code> block in &lt;code>index.md&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-go" data-lang="go">{{&amp;lt; figure src=&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;image-file-name.png&amp;#34;&lt;/span> alt=&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;Here is an image!&amp;#34;&lt;/span> &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This produces the block:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&amp;lt;&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">figure&lt;/span>&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">img&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">src&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;image-file-name.png&amp;#34;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">alt&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;Here is an image!&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">figure&lt;/span>&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Since this contains no preceding forward-slash &lt;code>/&lt;/code> in &lt;code>src&lt;/code>, this becomes a &lt;em>relative path&lt;/em>. This means the webserver will look for the image at the path relative to the current page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So when we navigate to &lt;code>blog/some-blog-post/&lt;/code> in our web browser (as dictated from the above tree structure), your browser will request the image at &lt;code>blog/some-blog-post/image-file-name.png&lt;/code> for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why is this relevant? This same &lt;code>&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code> block is being rendered in the description of your RSS XML file, including the relative image location. RSS is very simple and renders only complete URLs (e.g. &lt;code>https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/some-blog-post/image-file-name.png&lt;/code>) - so when we just specify the relative path, it cannot find the image and thus prints out the &lt;code>alt&lt;/code> text.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> if you specify images from a complete path such as &lt;code>/images/image-file-name.png&lt;/code> under &lt;code>static/images&lt;/code>, then this is not an issue for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="fix-image-rendering">Fix image rendering&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The fix for this involves some Go magic. We need to prepend the permalink for the current post that&amp;rsquo;s being printed out to anything that contains a relative path &lt;code>&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code> block.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We need to go back to the same line where we added &lt;code>.Content&lt;/code> and change it to:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">&amp;lt;description&amp;gt;&lt;/span>{{ replaceRE &amp;#34;img src=\&amp;#34;(.*?)\&amp;#34;&amp;#34; (printf &amp;#34;%s%s%s&amp;#34; &amp;#34;img src=\&amp;#34;&amp;#34; .Permalink &amp;#34;$1\&amp;#34;&amp;#34;) .Content | html }}&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">&amp;lt;/description&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This calls the Hugo function &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/functions/replacere/">replaceRE&lt;/a> which enables us to perform a find-and-replace using &lt;a href="https://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorial.html">regular expressions (regex)&lt;/a>, and it takes three inputs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>PATTERN&lt;/code> is the regex pattern used to find the text we want to remove
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>&amp;quot;img src=\&amp;quot;(.*?)\&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>REPLACEMENT&lt;/code> is the text that we want to replace the &lt;code>PATTERN&lt;/code> with
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>(printf &amp;quot;%s%s%s&amp;quot; &amp;quot;img src=\&amp;quot;&amp;quot; .Permalink &amp;quot;$1\&amp;quot;&amp;quot;)&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>INPUT&lt;/code> is the string we want to perform the find-and-replace on
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>.Content&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In the example above, we&amp;rsquo;re placing a &lt;a href="https://www.regular-expressions.info/brackets.html">capturing group&lt;/a> in the &lt;code>PATTERN&lt;/code> so that it will capture the contents inside &lt;code>src&lt;/code> and save them so that we can refer to it in the &lt;code>REPLACEMENT&lt;/code>, while removing &lt;code>img src=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>REPLACEMENT&lt;/code> is calling another Hugo function called &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/functions/printf/">printf&lt;/a> to construct the replacement text. We&amp;rsquo;re pretty much just injecting the page &lt;code>.Permalink&lt;/code> prior to the captured text from the &lt;code>PATTERN&lt;/code> - so that RSS can then display the complete URL. While adding back the &lt;code>img src=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/code> that was removed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>INPUT&lt;/code> will be the page &lt;code>.Content&lt;/code>, what we were printing out before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once we&amp;rsquo;ve made the change, images are now rendered properly!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>UPDATE 2020-05-16&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Upon posting this, I noticed I needed to do the same thing for hyperlinks referencing headings with the same post. For instance the markdown below which renders a hyperlink to a heading&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown">[&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">images to display in RSS content&lt;/span>](&lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">#rendering-images-in-rss-posts&lt;/span>)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Will render this in RSS:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&amp;lt;&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">a&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">href&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;https://jdheyburn.co.uk/#rendering-images-in-rss-posts&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Which does not take the reader to the right location at all. What we need to do is repeat the regex used above in &lt;code>rss.xml&lt;/code> to catch these and replace them with the complete URL. See below for the snippet.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-golang" data-lang="golang">{{&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">-&lt;/span> $content &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">:=&lt;/span> replaceRE &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;a href=\&amp;#34;(#.*?)\&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span> (printf &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;%s%s%s&amp;#34;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;a href=\&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span> .Permalink &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;$1\&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>) .Content &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">-&lt;/span>}}
{{&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">-&lt;/span> $content = replaceRE &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;img src=\&amp;#34;(.*?)\&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span> (printf &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;%s%s%s&amp;#34;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;img src=\&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span> .Permalink &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;$1\&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>) $content &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">-&lt;/span>}}
&amp;lt;description&amp;gt;{{ $content | html }}&amp;lt;&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">/&lt;/span>description&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="adding-cards-for-posts">Adding cards for posts&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Not dissimilar to &lt;a href="https://barkersocial.com/social-cards/">social media cards&lt;/a>, you can also have cards appear for your RSS posts in order to make them more attractive for readers to click on!&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">&lt;a href="inoreader-enclosure-card-view.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-6-three-steps-to-improve-hugos-rss-feeds/inoreader-enclosure-card-view.png"
alt="inoreader displaying images for each post when in card view"/> &lt;/a>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>While in card view for inoreader, we can see featured images being displayed&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>You can do these in RSS via the &lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/rss_tag_enclosure.asp">enclosure&lt;/a> tag&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&amp;lt;&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">enclosure&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">url&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;image-location.png&amp;#34;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">type&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;image/jpg&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">enclosure&lt;/span>&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If you have a look at our &lt;code>layouts/_default/rss.xml&lt;/code> file, we don&amp;rsquo;t have this defined. We could go and add it in now, but I would like a unified social media image to be used across all platforms. This will enable me to focus my effort on generating a single social media card image that is shared across all methods of consumption.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Based on the above, my theme (hugo-coder), renders the tags required for social media cards through the &lt;a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/tpl/tplimpl/embedded/templates/twitter_cards.html">internal template&lt;/a> for &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#use-the-twitter-cards-template">twitter_cards&lt;/a>.

...
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>The hierarchy of images used to render the social media card goes like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The first entry in the list of &lt;code>images&lt;/code> found in the post front matter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any image in the post leaf bundle containing &lt;code>feature&lt;/code> in its name&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any image in the post leaf bundle containing either &lt;code>cover&lt;/code> or &lt;code>thumbnail&lt;/code> in its name&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The default image defined at the site level params&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="adding-enclosure-tags">Adding enclosure tags&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We can effectively copy and paste the code being used for generating Twitter cards and modify it for enclosure tags. The snippet of code ultimately ends up looking like this 👇&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>Walking through what this is doing:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Lines 1-4 will use the image defined in the &lt;code>images&lt;/code> in the post front matter, if it exists
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I had to define &lt;code>{{-/* $pagePermalink := .Permalink */-}}&lt;/code> on line 1 to make &lt;code>.Permalink&lt;/code> available inside the &lt;code>with&lt;/code> block at line 4&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Line 7 will find an image containing &lt;code>feature&lt;/code> in its name, at the post leaf bundle section, if an image is not found previously&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Line 8 will revert to an image containing either &lt;code>cover&lt;/code> or &lt;code>thumbnail&lt;/code>, if an image is not found previously&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lines 12-13 will default to the image defined at the site level params&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>With lessons learnt trying to get &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-6-three-steps-to-improve-hugos-rss-feeds/#rendering-images-in-rss-posts">images to display in RSS content&lt;/a>, I am rendering the full URL of the image to ensure RSS is always able to retrieve it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m going to follow lines 12-13 above and have a default card defined at the site level parameters. In my &lt;code>config.toml&lt;/code> I&amp;rsquo;ll need to add the following&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-toml" data-lang="toml">[params]

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>&amp;hellip;while also ensuring that I&amp;rsquo;ve placed the image under &lt;code>static/images/jdheyburn_co_uk_card.png&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once all that is done and deployed - we will have an RSS post card that looks like this 🙌&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">&lt;a href="hugo-enclosure-card-view.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-6-three-steps-to-improve-hugos-rss-feeds/hugo-enclosure-card-view.png"
alt="inoreader displaying an image for a Hugo post"/> &lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>We can now advertise our RSS subscription URL to readers. My theme &lt;code>hugo-coder&lt;/code> supports this as a social button on the home page. We just need to add the below block to the &lt;code>config.toml&lt;/code> file.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-toml" data-lang="toml">[[params.social]]

type = &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;application/rss+xml&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Once done - our homepage will have the button displayed.&lt;/p>

Some of the things going to be covered are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Upgrading our Hugo theme&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Upgrading the Hugo version&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adding table of contents&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adding support for title emojis&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>So far since this website has launched we haven&amp;rsquo;t upgraded either the Hugo version used to build our website, alongside the theme being used. Hugo is a very active project with new features and bug fixes being added all the time. By not upgrading Hugo, we are missing out on enhancements that we can make to the site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As for upgrading the theme, improvements in the styling or even making use of said new features in Hugo can be added as part of the theme. Remember that when you execute a &lt;code>hugo&lt;/code> command, turning the website from markdown to rendered HTML files, that the theme chosen will be used to render those files.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="upgrading-hugo">Upgrading Hugo&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This varies depending on what OS you are running on, but it is pretty much identical as the steps taken to install Hugo in the &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-1-getting-started/#blog-bootstrapping">first place&lt;/a>. Even the &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#upgrade-hugo">documentation for upgrading&lt;/a> is a one-liner:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Upgrading Hugo is as easy as downloading and replacing the executable you’ve placed in your &lt;code>PATH&lt;/code>, or running &lt;code>brew upgrade hugo&lt;/code> if using Homebrew on macOS.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A quick execute of &lt;code>hugo version&lt;/code> tells us what we&amp;rsquo;re currently running. We can then have a look at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/">Hugo release page&lt;/a> to find the latest one - which at the time of writing is &lt;a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.68.3">0.68.3&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ hugo version
Hugo Static Site Generator v0.58.3-4AAC02D4/extended linux/amd64 BuildDate: 2019-09-19T15:34:54Z
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I run Linux so I would need to replace the executable on my &lt;code>PATH&lt;/code>. This can be done with a handy script to pull the archive and install it for us.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">HUGO_VERSION&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;0.68.3&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
wget &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">${&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">HUGO_VERSION&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">}&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">/hugo_extended_&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">${&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">HUGO_VERSION&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">}&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">_Linux-64bit.tar.gz&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
tar -zxvf &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;hugo_extended_&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">${&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">HUGO_VERSION&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">}&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">_Linux-64bit.tar.gz&amp;#34;&lt;/span> hugo
sudo mv -v hugo /usr/local/bin
hugo version
rm &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;hugo_extended_&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">${&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">HUGO_VERSION&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">}&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">_Linux-64bit.tar.gz&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Remember that the hugo-coder theme requires the extended version of Hugo in order for it to render files correctly.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You can see where &lt;code>hugo&lt;/code> is currently installed on your system with the command &lt;code>which hugo&lt;/code>, given it is in your &lt;code>PATH&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Executing &lt;code>hugo version&lt;/code> one more time confirms if the upgrade took place.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ hugo version
Hugo Static Site Generator v0.68.3-157669A0/extended linux/amd64 BuildDate: 2020-03-24T12:13:38Z
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="testing-for-any-issues">Testing For Any Issues&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>At this point I would advise you do some testing with the new version to determine if your site is not only rendering as expected but functioning too. You can do this with the good old &lt;code>hugo serve&lt;/code> command as you would have used before when writing out articles, and fixing anything that looks out of place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, since I&amp;rsquo;m going to be upgrading the hugo theme too, I&amp;rsquo;ll do my testing in one hit &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-5-updates-galore/#validation-and-testing">later in this post&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="updating-hugo-in-cicd">Updating Hugo in CI/CD&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve only upgrading Hugo on our machines, but we also need to upgrade it in our CI/CD pipeline to ensure it deploys with the correct rendering too. We set this up in parts &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-3-1-deployment-methods-travisci/">3.1&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-3-2-deployment-methods-github-actions/">3.2&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m using GitHub Actions for my CI/CD pipeline, so I need to head to &lt;code>.github/workflows/deploy.yml&lt;/code> and change &lt;code>hugo-version: &amp;quot;0.58.3&amp;quot;&lt;/code> to &lt;code>hugo-version: &amp;quot;0.68.3&amp;quot;&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s as easy as that thanks to the pre-made GitHub Action!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="upgrading-hugo-theme">Upgrading Hugo Theme&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="a-git-submodules-recap">A git submodules recap&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As mentioned before, I&amp;rsquo;m using hugo-coder as the theme for my Hugo website which is being pulled as a submodule in my git repository. I can interface with it via the command &lt;code>git submodules&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the cool things about &lt;code>git submodules&lt;/code> is I don&amp;rsquo;t need to have a copy of the source code for the theme in my project. I can just reference the codebase at a particular point in time - or a commit, and git will pull in the resources for which then my Hugo website can utilise it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We already defined this back in the &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-1-getting-started/">first post of this series&lt;/a>, in our root directory we created a file called &lt;code>.gitmodules&lt;/code> with the following contents:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">[&lt;/span>submodule &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;themes/hugo-coder&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">]&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">path&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span> themes/hugo-coder
&lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">url&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span> https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder.git
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Line by line, we are giving the submodule a name, telling git where to check out the module to, and lastly where git can find the repository for the module when we checkout our project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we pull in the submodule for the first time, it creates a tree in our projects &lt;code>.git/modules&lt;/code> filled with metadata about the submodule.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ tree .git/modules/themes/hugo-coder -L &lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">1&lt;/span>

&lt;p>The &lt;code>.git/&lt;/code> directory contains all the metadata about your repository so that &lt;code>git&lt;/code> knows where to pull/push to/from the repository, &lt;a href="https://githowto.com/git_internals_git_directory">amongst other things&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>To upgrade submodules in your project, you simply need to execute the command below:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git submodule update --recursive --remote
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>We can then check the value in &lt;code>.git/modules/themes/hugo-coder/HEAD&lt;/code> and see what this is updated to.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ cat .git/modules/themes/hugo-coder/HEAD

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Nice - this has changed from the previous value. We can jump over to GitHub to verify this is indeed the latest version.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="validation-and-testing">Validation and Testing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now comes the testing part, ensuring that everything is working as intended with both the new Hugo version and the latest hugo-coder submodule. Some of the issues I came across were:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="center-tags-not-rending-correctly">&lt;code>&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;&lt;/code> tags not rending correctly&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I believe the new Hugo version broke this one, where images that were wrapped in &lt;code>&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;&lt;/code> tags were simply disappearing. I had been wrapping &lt;code>{{&amp;lt; figure ... &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code> shortcodes in &lt;code>&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;&lt;/code> tags in order to horizontally centre images - but it looks like the new version causes these images to appear completely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It looks like the &lt;code>figure&lt;/code> shortcodes now support &lt;code>center&lt;/code> as a &lt;code>class&lt;/code> property. Therefore we go from&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;{{&amp;lt; figure src=&amp;quot;image-name.png&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>{{&amp;lt; figure src=&amp;quot;image-name.png&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;center&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="lists-not-rendering-as-before">Lists not rendering as before&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It turns out that my markdown for articles wasn&amp;rsquo;t as watertight as I thought; Hugo is now a whole lot more strict in ensuring your syntax is correct. Check these two before and after for comparison.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-5-updates-galore/old-render-list.png" class="screenshotimg"
alt="Screenshot showing old, proper list render"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-5-updates-galore/new-render-list.png" class="screenshotimg"
alt="Screenshot showing new, incorrect list render"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>For this I just needed to fix the markdown by adding another indent to the list item.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="git-diff-list.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-5-updates-galore/git-diff-list.png"
alt="Screenshot showing git diff between old and new list"/> &lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I saw several cases of this, and including a &lt;a href="https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli">markdown linter&lt;/a> in the CI/CD pipeline would help to prevent this. This is something I&amp;rsquo;ll look to include in the near future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="adding-new-features">Adding New Features&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The whole reason to upgrade both Hugo and the theme was to explore some of the new features that come in both of them, so let&amp;rsquo;s get adding them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="adding-series-links-in-content-footer">Adding Series Links in Content Footer&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The hugo-coder theme now has better support for series - these are articles that directly follow on from one another, such as this Who Goes Blogging one. Series are nothing new to Hugo and we could have done them with the version we upgraded from, only in &lt;a href="https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/commit/27e83b1e5a9d8b7bbd42d202bd5ef57adcce659b">this commit for hugo-coder&lt;/a> has it added a layout for it to be rendered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To create a series, we use the &lt;code>series&lt;/code> front matter setting for articles. For the Who Goes Blogging articles, adding the front matter to them looks like this.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml">---
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">date&lt;/span>: 2020-03-10
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">title&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;Who Goes Blogging 3.2: Deployment Methods - GitHub Actions&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#6272a4">#...&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="display:block;width:100%;background-color:#3d3f4a">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">series&lt;/span>:
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:block;width:100%;background-color:#3d3f4a"> - Who Goes Blogging
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">tags&lt;/span>:
&lt;span style="color:#6272a4">#...&lt;/span>
---
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Once this is done for all pages, hugo-coder will render the &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-5-updates-galore/#conclusion">&lt;strong>See also in &amp;hellip;&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> section at the article footer.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-5-updates-galore/series-footer-section.png" class="screenshotimg"
alt="Screenshot showing series rendered in the page footer"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="adding-table-of-contents">Adding Table of Contents&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Okay this one isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly a new feature of the theme, but since we&amp;rsquo;re playing around we may as well make use of this opportunity. Table of contents (TOC) aren&amp;rsquo;t included by default in the &lt;code>hugo-coder&lt;/code> theme, so we need to add it in ourselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is some &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/toc/">documentation&lt;/a> on how to add TOC to your articles. Before we do that we need to revisit how layouts are organised as discussed briefly in &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-4-content-structure-and-refactoring/#fixing-article-rendering">a previous post&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="template-lookup-order-primer">Template Lookup Order Primer&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The type of a markdown file (defined by the front matter setting &lt;code>type&lt;/code>) tells Hugo where to look for in the &lt;code>layouts/&lt;/code> directory of your project. The Hugo theme you&amp;rsquo;re using will already have these all defined, hence why they are predefined themes! Before Hugo looks for these layout HTML files in your theme, it will check for them in your projects &lt;code>layouts/&lt;/code> directory first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In other words, the order of precedence (or hierarchy) for HTML files is anything in the project &lt;code>layouts/&lt;/code> directory takes a higher priority than that in your theme - as described in Hugo&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/lookup-order/">documentation for template lookup order&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See below for a directory tree explaning this - a lot of content has been removed for brevity.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ tree layouts

└── single.html &lt;span style="color:#6272a4"># hugo will ignore this one in the themes directory&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="implementation">Implementation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The primer above gives a hint as to what file we need to modify. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/blob/master/layouts/posts/single.html">&lt;code>single.html&lt;/code>&lt;/a> file is in charge of how articles are rendered. Since we want everything else to remain the same about this file, we can take a copy of the file as it currently stands and place it into our project root.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mkdir layouts/posts
cp -v themes/hugo-coder/layouts/posts/single.html layouts/posts
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I won&amp;rsquo;t go into the details here, I&amp;rsquo;ll leave that to you to make changes to see how they affect the rendering of the page.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I want the TOC to appear before the main content, but after the featured image for the article (if there is any). Based on this the files is going to need the highlighted change below.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">
&lt;table style="border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;">&lt;tr>&lt;td style="vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;">

&lt;/span>&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">35
&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>
&lt;td style="vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%">
&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&amp;lt;&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">div&lt;/span>&amp;gt;
{{ if .Params.featured_image }}
&amp;lt;&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">img&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">src&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;{{ .Params.featured_image }}&amp;#34;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">alt&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;Featured image&amp;#34;&lt;/span> /&amp;gt;
{{ end }}
&lt;span style="display:block;width:100%;background-color:#3d3f4a"> {{ partial &amp;#34;toc.html&amp;#34; . }}
&lt;/span> {{ .Content }}
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">div&lt;/span>&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re not done there - we&amp;rsquo;ve referenced a &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/">partial template file&lt;/a> here. These allow us to reuse HTML files in multiple places, or to break up a large HTML file into smaller, more easier to manage chunks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Partial templates are found under the &lt;code>layouts/partials&lt;/code> directory and follow the same principle as defined in the primer for template lookups, and are referenced back as &lt;code>{{ partial &amp;quot;&amp;lt;partial_name&amp;gt;.html&amp;quot; . }}&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s go ahead and create the &lt;code>layouts/partials/toc.html&lt;/code> file and populate it as below.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-html" data-lang="html">{{ if and (gt .WordCount 400 ) (.Site.Params.toc) }}
&amp;lt;&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">aside&lt;/span>&amp;gt;
{{.TableOfContents}}
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">aside&lt;/span>&amp;gt;
{{ end }}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This is similar to &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/toc/#template-example-toc-partial">Hugo&amp;rsquo;s example&lt;/a> but just tweaked a bit. I&amp;rsquo;m not looking to do anything too fancy with the styling just yet, but maybe later on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Previewing it by &lt;code>hugo serve&lt;/code> we should get something that appears as below.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-5-updates-galore/completed-toc.png" class="screenshotimg"

&lt;/figure>
&lt;h3 id="bugs-along-the-way">Bugs Along The Way&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As the heading suggests, there were a few extra things I needed to change before releasing it into the wild.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="fix-improper-headings">Fix Improper Headings&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Per &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/toc/#usage">Table of Contents Usage documentation&lt;/a>, Hugo will render from &lt;code>&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/code> headings, which are defined as &lt;code>##&lt;/code> in markdown. So &lt;code># Introduction&lt;/code> would not be included in the TOC, but &lt;code>## Introduction&lt;/code> will.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a problem for some of my articles since I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing headings liberally at the wrong level.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-5-updates-galore/improper-toc-headings.png" class="screenshotimg"
alt="Screenshot showing table of contents not including all headings for a post"/> &lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Notice the &lt;strong>Applying Cartography&lt;/strong> heading doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear in the TOC&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The given example above shows what happens when we use &lt;code># Heading Name&lt;/code> instead of &lt;code>## Heading Name&lt;/code>. To fix this I just need to go through each heading and make sure top-level headings begin with &lt;code>##&lt;/code> and any subheadings have an additional &lt;code>#&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-5-updates-galore/proper-toc-headings.png" class="screenshotimg"
alt="Screenshot showing table of contents fixed with correct heading indentation"/> &lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Much better!&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h4 id="fix-emojis">Fix Emojis&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love the use of emojis ⁉️ Well I don&amp;rsquo;t when they render badly. Before this exercise I was using a custom shortcode to render them.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-html" data-lang="html"># layouts/shortcodes/emoji.html
{{ .Get 0 | emojify }}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/">Shortcodes&lt;/a> are similar to partial templates in that they contain HTML, but they are usually for referring to one HTML element as opposed to multiple.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Then in my markdown I would refer back to them such as &lt;code>{{&amp;lt; emoji &amp;quot;:wave:&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code>. However in headings they rendered as below&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-5-updates-galore/bad-emojis-headings.png" class="screenshotimg"
alt="Screenshot showing poorly rendered emojis in Table of Contents"/> &lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Hugo clearly finds this hysterical&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a weird one for sure - especially since they render fine in the headings themselves already&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-5-updates-galore/good-emoji-heading-1.png" class="screenshotimg"
alt="Screenshot with heading example with emoji 1"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;figure class="center">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-5-updates-galore/good-emoji-heading-2.png" class="screenshotimg"
alt="Screenshot with heading example with emoji 2"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>There is a fix for these, and it&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;em>rendering emojis the correct way!&lt;/em> 😅&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Firstly in the site &lt;code>config.toml&lt;/code> I added &lt;code>enableEmoji = true&lt;/code> at the root level and then proceeded to change all occurrence of &lt;code>{{&amp;lt; emoji &amp;quot;:emoji_name:&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code> to &lt;code>:emoji_name:&lt;/code>. With that I can then remove &lt;code>layouts/shortcodes/emoji.html&lt;/code> since it&amp;rsquo;s not being referred back to anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-5-updates-galore/correct-emoji-headings.png" class="screenshotimg"
alt="Screenshot with correct emoji rendering in table of contents"/> &lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Nicely done&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h4 id="markdown-not-rendering">Markdown Not Rendering&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I also noticed that markdown wasn&amp;rsquo;t rendering properly too. Given the markdown &lt;code>## Spice Up Your ~~Life~~ Python 🐍&lt;/code>, which renders as a heading in the screenshot below&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-5-updates-galore/markdown-heading-render.png" class="screenshotimg"
alt="Screenshot showing a heading formatted correctly with markdown"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>But in the table of contents it appears without the tilde strikethrough (&lt;code>~&lt;/code>) rendering.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-5-updates-galore/incorrect-markdown-rendering-toc.png" class="screenshotimg"
alt="Screenshot showing tilde strikethrough not appearing in table of content entry"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This looks to be a bug within Hugo itself, since I was able to get &lt;strong>strong&lt;/strong> and &lt;em>emphasise&lt;/em> to render fine - I &lt;a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/7169">raised an issue&lt;/a> on the project - I can live with it for now.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="emojify-everything">Emojify Everything!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Continuing on the theme of emojis; we were able to get them to appear in the Table of Contents fine. But what about in the titles of the articles themselves? We can add them in the &lt;code>title&lt;/code> front matter setting like below:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml">---
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">date&lt;/span>: 2019-07-05
&lt;span style="display:block;width:100%;background-color:#3d3f4a">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">title&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;:​​​snake: Three Ways To Spice Up Your Python Code&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#6272a4"># ...&lt;/span>
---
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Having a look around the site we see these aren&amp;rsquo;t getting rendered correctly in a number of places&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>(1)&lt;/strong> Post title&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-5-updates-galore/broken-emoji-post-title.png" class="screenshotimg"
alt="Screenshot of broken emoji on post title"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>(2)&lt;/strong> Browser title&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">&lt;a href="broken-emoji-browser-title.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-5-updates-galore/broken-emoji-browser-title.png"

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>(3)&lt;/strong> Type list entry&lt;/p>

&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-5-updates-galore/broken-emoji-list.png" class="screenshotimg"
alt="Screenshot of broken emoji rendering on lists"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This is all to do with how the theme is rendering these, they are not &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/functions/emojify/">emojifying&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; the text it is receiving. This is easy to fix but it involves us copying over the respective files where they are being rendered from in hugo-coder and overwriting thme in our project root (back to &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-5-updates-galore/#template-lookup-order-primer">template ordering&lt;/a> again!).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="fix-post--browser-title">Fix Post &amp;amp; Browser Title&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We can kill two birds with one stone since these are both found in the same file, the &lt;code>layouts/posts/single.html&lt;/code> file - this is the main file used to render the article page. If you followed &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-5-updates-galore/#implementation">above&lt;/a>, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice we already copied across that file to our project root in order to add a TOC.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We need to go back to that file and &lt;em>emojify&lt;/em> both the main article heading, alongside the browser title to change any occurrence of &lt;code>{{ .Title }}&lt;/code> to &lt;code>{{ .Title | emojify }}&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By doing this we will &lt;em>always&lt;/em> emojify the titles even if in our &lt;code>config.toml&lt;/code> we specified &lt;code>enableEmoji = false&lt;/code>, or didn&amp;rsquo;t specify it at all. This will conflict with the default state of the setting which is &lt;code>false&lt;/code>. We could do some conditional logic on the &lt;code>enableEmoji&lt;/code> setting, but unfortunately this isn&amp;rsquo;t exposed to us to be able to perform something like &lt;code>{{ if .Site.enableEmoji }}&lt;/code>. Because of this we cannot create a pull request (PR) to merge it in with the &lt;code>hugo-coder&lt;/code> theme. I&amp;rsquo;ve raised a &lt;a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/7171">couple&lt;/a> of &lt;a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/7170">issues&lt;/a> against Hugo requesting these features.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since this is just for my website I am okay with the overriding behaviour of emojiying the title.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See the Gist below for my completed &lt;code>single.html&lt;/code> file, including the TOC addition earlier.&lt;/p>
&lt;script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/jdheyburn/35a10e346848379ec5f6f87cb48454cd/3a30b153aae5a761f62293add95187e280d8c3d3.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ll notice I&amp;rsquo;m emojifying (surely I&amp;rsquo;ve said this enough times to make it into the Oxford Dictionary?!) the site title too. This is incase myself (or even yourselves) wish to add emojis there too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The end result for the title will look like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-5-updates-galore/fixed-emoji-post-title.png" class="screenshotimg"
alt="Screenshot of fixed emoji on post title"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>And the browser title is fixed accordingly:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">&lt;a href="fixed-emoji-browser-title.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-5-updates-galore/fixed-emoji-browser-title.png"
alt="Screenshot of fixed emoji on browser title"/> &lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h3 id="fix-type-list-entry">Fix Type List Entry&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We need to find the file in the theme that determines how to render a list entry for a page of type &lt;code>posts&lt;/code> and make the modification there - &lt;code>layouts/posts/li.html&lt;/code>. We&amp;rsquo;ll need to do the same here as we did for &lt;code>single.html&lt;/code> and copy it to our project root.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">cp -v themes/hugo-coder/layouts/posts/li.html layouts/posts
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Likewise for the title in the previous section, we need to emojify the title of the article as it&amp;rsquo;s being listed out.&lt;/p>
&lt;script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/jdheyburn/177fb9f74a38306d9257fb7302ba221c.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>Once done, we can see it reflect nicely in the list:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">

&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There was a lot covered in this post, to recap we&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Upgraded the Hugo version used to render the website locally, as well as in the CI/CD pipeline&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Also updated the version of the theme we&amp;rsquo;re using
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Made use of new features that came with it such as series links&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added a table of contents to our longer articles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added support for emojis in post titles&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

Some of the improvements I want to make are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Moving content articles from a flat structure to a leaf bundle&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rename content section to &lt;strong>blog&lt;/strong> from &lt;strong>posts&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Upgrading &lt;code>hugo-coder&lt;/code> theme and &lt;code>hugo&lt;/code> version&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adding a table of contents to the pages&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;hellip; and further improvements as I find them&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This post will cover items 1-2, the others will be in a follow up post.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="content-article-reorganising">Content Article Reorganising&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Hugo has a few different ways you can organise your content, known as &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/">Page Bundles&lt;/a>. Up to now I&amp;rsquo;ve adopted &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/#branch-bundles">Branch Bundles&lt;/a> where I have all my articles in named markdown files under the &lt;code>content/posts&lt;/code> directory - acting as the branch bundle, and storing all images under &lt;code>static/images&lt;/code> - so the article at &lt;code>content/posts/blog-bootstrap.md&lt;/code> will be available at &lt;code>/posts/blog-bootstrap/&lt;/code>. As time has gone on, the images directory has gotten rather large and difficult to understand what images apply to what posts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The alternative way to organise content is the &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/#leaf-bundles">Leaf Bundle&lt;/a>. This is where at a branch level you have a directory with the name of the article you wish to publish, followed by an &lt;code>index.md&lt;/code> file with the article content - such as &lt;code>content/posts/blog-bootstrap/index.md&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Any page resources defined in this directory can be referenced relatively in the markdown files within it, such that any images can be stored within &lt;code>content/posts/blog-bootstrap/&lt;/code> and referred to in the markdown as &lt;code>figure src=&amp;quot;my-relative-img.png&amp;quot; ...&lt;/code> as opposed to &lt;code>src=&amp;quot;/images/my-not-relative-img.png&amp;quot; ...&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This allows me to organise content much more effectively such that we will be going from this structure:&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Breaking down the script, firstly we are retrieving all posts that aren&amp;rsquo;t already converted to a leaf bundle and looping over them, where lines 4-9 performs the conversion itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once that is done then we need to get all images that are referenced in that post and move them to the new leaf bundle for the post. This is done in lines 12-17.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lastly, we then need to change the post content itself so that it references images in the location relative to the leaf bundle instead of under &lt;code>static/images&lt;/code> - lines 21-26 accomplish this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hugo allows you to define &lt;code>img&lt;/code> blocks in several ways, where I&amp;rsquo;m currently using 3 of these methods. I &lt;del>probably&lt;/del> should replace these with one approach - for the time being 3 &lt;code>sed&lt;/code> commands will do the trick for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m sure that a few lines could be cut out with some better regex expressions - but I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert at them so I&amp;rsquo;d rather crack on with what I know 😃&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="renaming-content-section">Renaming Content Section&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A gripe I&amp;rsquo;ve had with my site is when you click on &lt;strong>Blog&lt;/strong> in the site header it takes you to &lt;strong>Posts&lt;/strong>. Similar to the previous section this is because of &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/#branch-bundles">Branch Bundles&lt;/a> which are any directory that sits underneath the &lt;code>content&lt;/code> directory. The bundle name here is what forms the URL and the parent page for those articles &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/sections/">as defined&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Based on this information, migrating should be as easy as&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Despite doing this, we come across some problems&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>We lose the correct rendering for the article

&lt;li>Hugo doesn&amp;rsquo;t know how to render content with type &lt;code>blog&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Existing URL links are broken
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>All hyperlinks both internal and external are referring to articles at &lt;code>/posts/&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Blog landing page is now &lt;strong>Blogs&lt;/strong>?? (see below)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s walk through them one by one.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="fixing-article-rendering">Fixing Article Rendering&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We just made our existing articles leaf bundles that sat under &lt;code>content/posts&lt;/code>, but now this is renamed to &lt;code>content/blog&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The section of which your article sits underneath also tells Hugo how it should render the page - known as &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/types/#defining-a-content-type">Content Types&lt;/a>. Take the article blog-bootstrap which is under &lt;code>posts&lt;/code>; Hugo will look in the theme for &lt;code>layouts/posts&lt;/code> for &lt;code>html&lt;/code> files to render it against* - this is how the articles go from a markdown file to rendered HTML.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>* Hugo will &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/lookup-order/">first look&lt;/a> in your local project for any overriding files.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ tree themes/hugo-coder/layouts/posts

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>When we change the section name the article sits in, Hugo will not know how to render it correctly and will resolve to the default rendering for the theme. This ends us with something like the below.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="posts-blog-rendering-error.png">

&lt;p>Correct rendering on the left - notice publish date, minutes to read, and tags are missing&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>One way of fixing this would be to also change the &lt;code>hugo-coder&lt;/code> theme from &lt;code>layouts/posts&lt;/code> to &lt;code>layouts/blog&lt;/code> - however a much simpler solution exists. We can use the &lt;code>type&lt;/code> front matter setting to tell Hugo what layout to use to render it.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml">---

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Hugo &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter">front matter&lt;/a> are content parameter settings you place into the heading of the content - an example of this is right above!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Having to define this in every new article can become repetitive. We can make this easier for ourselves by using &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/">archetypes&lt;/a>; which are essentially templates that new content is templated from.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In your project root directory, create the &lt;code>archetypes/blog&lt;/code> directory and in there a file called &lt;code>index.md&lt;/code>, and populate it with the below:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml">---
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">draft&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">true&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">type&lt;/span>: posts
&lt;span style="color:#6272a4"># ... Add in other defaults as you see fit&lt;/span>
---
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>You can then create new content from this template like so:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ hugo new --kind blog blog/blog-post

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="fixing-existing-urls">Fixing Existing URLs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Changing the section the article is in affects the URL too; meaning articles will appear at &lt;code>https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/blog-bootstrap/&lt;/code> instead of &lt;code>https://jdheyburn.co.uk/posts/blog-bootstrap/&lt;/code>. Therefore existing hyperlinks pointing to these articles will break.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tnere is another quick fix available for us through the front matter setting &lt;code>aliases&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="from-blogs-to-blog">From Blogs to Blog&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Earlier on, we came across this weird bug&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="blogs-landing-page.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-4-content-structure-and-refactoring/blogs-landing-page.png"
alt="Screenshot of Blog landing page with incorrect Blogs title"/> &lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This is occurring because of the translation feature of Hugo (sourced from &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/functions/i18n/">i18n&lt;/a>) which converts singular word titles to plural on content section landing pages, since Hugo is listing them out. This made sense when our previous section name was posts, but now we&amp;rsquo;d rather it have say blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remembering that &lt;code>content/blog&lt;/code> is a &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/#branch-bundles">branch bundle&lt;/a>, we can override the inferred title with a &lt;code>_index.md&lt;/code> file at that directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#6272a4"># content/blog/_index.md&lt;/span>
---
title: Blog
type: posts
---
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>We have another &lt;code>type: posts&lt;/code> setting here because similar to above, we want Hugo to render the landing page the same as we did for posts.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="heading-to-blog">Heading to Blog&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Lastly and most easily, the &lt;strong>Blog&lt;/strong> shortcut at the top-right corner of the page still directs us to &lt;code>/posts&lt;/code> - we need to change that in the top-level &lt;code>config.toml&lt;/code> to point to &lt;code>/blog&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-toml" data-lang="toml">[[languages.en.menu.main]]
name = &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;Blog&amp;#34;&lt;/span>

&lt;p>In the &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/posts/who-goes-blogging-3-1-deployment-methods-travisci/">previous post&lt;/a> we looked at moving to a CI/CD model by moving from the &lt;code>deploy.sh&lt;/code> script to TravisCI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post we will look at how we can migrate from TravisCI to &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/getting-started-with-github-actions/about-github-actions">GitHub Actions&lt;/a>, GitHub&amp;rsquo;s own CI/CD tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post will also be useful if you are looking to onboard GitHub Actions as your CI/CD pipeline! 🚀&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="benefits-">Benefits ✅&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about why we want to migrate away from TravisCI in the first place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Firstly and most importantly&lt;/strong>, there is a whole community of shared actions (a set of build instructions) which can save you a &lt;em>huge&lt;/em> amount of time when it comes to piecing together a CI pipeline. If the TravisCI config seemed a bit intimidating, then these will be a whole lot more gentler to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whereas in our Travis config we had to define the individual commands needed to set up our environment and then how to build it, there&amp;rsquo;s an &lt;a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/hugo-setup">action&lt;/a> for that! Want to include some markdown linting? There&amp;rsquo;s an &lt;a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/markdownlint-cli">action&lt;/a> for that!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think you folks get the picture now. There&amp;rsquo;s an &lt;a href="https://github.com/sdras/awesome-actions">awesome-actions&lt;/a> repository worth checking out for more actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Secondly&lt;/strong>, all your DevOps tools are in one place! I&amp;rsquo;m a big sucker for &lt;a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab&lt;/a> and while I don&amp;rsquo;t use it for my personal projects, I&amp;rsquo;ve used it in a past life and found its seamless integration with all other tools second-to-none. Not having to worry about integrating between multiple services can only increase your productivity - allowing you to focus more on the application you&amp;rsquo;re writing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Lastly&lt;/strong>, all configuration is managed in the workflow configuration file. One enhancement in particular that we will be introducing can be achieved with an additional setting in the workflow config file; for us to achieve the same in Travis would have to be done via the GUI. I&amp;rsquo;m a big sucker for having configuration baked into code so this is a very good plus.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="pricing-">Pricing ⏰&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>However&lt;/strong> - one downsides to GitHub Actions is how many build minutes you get. Remember Travis allowed unlimited build minutes for a public repository? With Actions - you are limited to &lt;a href="https://github.com/pricing">2,000 minutes in their free plan&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been building your project in Travis already, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice it has been building (in my case at least) in ~30 seconds. With a bit of maths we can then say we will have 4,000 builds in a month on GitHub Actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given that this isn&amp;rsquo;t a huge project with multiple contributors working on it, I think it&amp;rsquo;s safe to say we won&amp;rsquo;t ever reach this limit - unless you&amp;rsquo;re churning out blog posts left right and centre!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sound good? Let&amp;rsquo;s go.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="creating-our-workflow">Creating Our Workflow&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Like all great services in the world, there is &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions">great documentation&lt;/a> to go along with them. Take a look over there if you&amp;rsquo;d like the detailed version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I will be focusing on is the documentation for two sets of predefined actions; &lt;a href="https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo">actions-hugo&lt;/a> for building our website, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages">actions-gh-pages&lt;/a> for deploying it to GitHub Pages.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="deployment-keys-setup">Deployment Keys Setup&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The very first thing we need to do is set up some keys that will allow our source repository (where the workflow will reside on) to push the built project to the GitHub Pages repo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In your terminal, create those keys now and copy the contents of the public key to your clipboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b &lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">4096&lt;/span> -C &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">$(&lt;/span>git config user.email&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">)&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;&lt;/span> -f ~/.ssh/gh-pages -N &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Your identification has been saved in /home/jdheyburn/.ssh/gh-pages.
Your public key has been saved in /home/jdheyburn/.ssh/gh-pages.pub
&lt;span style="color:#6272a4"># ...&lt;/span>
$ pbcopy &amp;lt; ~/.ssh/gh-pages.pub
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>macOS has a handy terminal command to copy file contents to the clipboard called &lt;code>pbcopy&lt;/code>. I&amp;rsquo;ve created an alias on my Linux laptop that does the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>alias pbcopy=&amp;quot;xclip -selection clipboard&amp;quot;&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In GitHub load up your GitHub Pages repo and navigate to &lt;code>Settings&lt;/code> and then &lt;code>Deploy keys&lt;/code>. Give it an appropriate name, and paste in the public key. Make sure you check &lt;code>Allow write access&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="gha-deploy-key.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-3-2-deployment-methods-github-actions/gha-deploy-key.png"
alt="GitHub Pages repo deploy keys page"/> &lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Copy the contents of the &lt;em>private key&lt;/em> you created earlier (perhaps using your new command?! 😏) and navigate to the source code repository&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>Settings&lt;/code> page, then &lt;code>Secrets&lt;/code>. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to give it a sensible name as this then referred to later in the workflow configuration. Paste the private key in the value field.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="gha-secrets-key.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-3-2-deployment-methods-github-actions/gha-secrets-key.png"
alt="GitHub source code repo secrets page"/> &lt;/a>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>No secrets here!&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h3 id="workflow-configuration">Workflow Configuration&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the root directory of your source code repo, create a directory called &lt;code>.github/workflows&lt;/code>. In this directory is where GitHub Actions will look for jobs to do. Create a &lt;code>yml&lt;/code> file in this directory to contain your build job definition. I went ahead and named mine &lt;code>deploy.yml&lt;/code>, but you can name it whatever you like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used the &lt;a href="https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages#%EF%B8%8F-repository-type---project">example&lt;/a> provided in the &lt;code>actions-gh-pages&lt;/code> documentation as a base for my build definition.&lt;/p>
&lt;script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/jdheyburn/b4b2cad15604de30f21ad0e1a85ee6b9.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>This config is much simpler to understand than the Travis one - let&amp;rsquo;s break it down once more.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="build-metadata-and-environment">Build Metadata and Environment&lt;/h4>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">name&lt;/span>: Build and deploy to jdheyburn.github.io

&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">branches&lt;/span>:

&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">schedule&lt;/span>:
- &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">cron&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;0 10 * * *&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">jobs&lt;/span>:
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">deploy&lt;/span>:
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">runs-on&lt;/span>: ubuntu&lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">-18.04&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This is pretty box standard at this point. We&amp;rsquo;re simply giving the name to the workflow and saying to run it on every push to the &lt;code>master&lt;/code> branch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An enhancement that we&amp;rsquo;re adding is the &lt;code>on.schedule.cron&lt;/code> setting. This tells Actions not only to build the project on every push to the &lt;code>master&lt;/code> branch but on a timed schedule too - in my example this is at 10am everyday. We could have done the same via Travis, but that can only be &lt;a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/cron-jobs/">configured via the GUI&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The benefit to this is the way in which Hugo generates content. Hugo will only build content pages where the date on the content is either today or in the past, and is not a draft.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore if you had written a post due to be published in the future, you can define that date and have the daily Hugo build publish it when that date has been reached - which is exactly how this blog post was published!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;code>jobs&lt;/code> is the field that contains the work we want to run. We&amp;rsquo;re giving the job a name of &lt;code>deploy&lt;/code> and telling it to run on &lt;code>ubuntu-18.04&lt;/code> - which is the equivalent to &lt;code>bionic&lt;/code> in Ubuntu.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In order to keep our build the same as Travis&amp;rsquo;s, we could instruct the job to run on &lt;code>ubuntu-16.04&lt;/code>, nonetheless I&amp;rsquo;m pretty confident it will run on the next &lt;a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases">LTS of Ubuntu&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here we&amp;rsquo;re executing the GitHub &lt;a href="https://github.com/actions/checkout">checkout action&lt;/a> which will pull the repo to the build server. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that this action version I&amp;rsquo;m using here doesn&amp;rsquo;t checkout git submodules too - which is a problem for us as that&amp;rsquo;s how we&amp;rsquo;re currently pulling the theme for our Hugo site. We can workaround it with the next step in the build - &lt;code>Checkout submodules&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This functionality was available in v1 of the action, so you can use that if you&amp;rsquo;d prefer:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">steps&lt;/span>:

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that we didn&amp;rsquo;t have to do this step for Travis - since it will checkout the repository with submodules already.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is because GitHub Actions can be used for many more things than just repository code manipulation where you may not necessarily need the repo checked out.&lt;/p>

It can take in a number of parameters to allow us to customise it; for us we&amp;rsquo;re only concerned with hardcoding the version of Hugo, and to use the Hugo Extended binary as required by our theme.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>At the time of writing 0.58.3 is not the latest version of Hugo, whereas when I wrote &lt;code>.travis.yml&lt;/code> it was. I want the GitHub Actions build to be as close as possible to the TravisCI build in order to make them as similar as possible to prevent any unexpected build errors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once I&amp;rsquo;ve achieved a successful build - I&amp;rsquo;ll look to upgrade to a newer version, and then iron out any issues from there.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>deploy_key&lt;/code> is the &lt;em>private key&lt;/em> we set up &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-3-2-deployment-methods-github-actions/#deployment-keys-setup">earlier in this post&lt;/a> in &lt;code>Settings&lt;/code> -&amp;gt; &lt;code>Secrets&lt;/code>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you didn&amp;rsquo;t name yours &lt;code>DEPLOY_KEY&lt;/code> then you&amp;rsquo;ll need to change it here too.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>external_repository&lt;/code> tells the action where we want the built website to go to - we set this to our GitHub Pages repo&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>publish_branch&lt;/code> is the branch of the repo we publish to&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>publish_dir&lt;/code> is the directory on the build server that we want to push to the repo
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Remember that &lt;code>hugo&lt;/code> builds the website to the &lt;code>public&lt;/code> directory locally&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>commit_message&lt;/code> allows us to specify a custom commit message to the target repo
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Here I am telling it to inherit the commit message used in the source repo&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="bringing-it-all-together-again">Bringing It All Together (Again)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re migrating from a previous CI tool (perhaps Travis?) then you&amp;rsquo;ll need to disable the builds on there since you may cause a conflict either build process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Travis, you can do that by navigating to your source code repo settings on Travis (&lt;a href="https://travis-ci.com/jdheyburn/jdheyburn.co.uk/settings">https://travis-ci.com/jdheyburn/jdheyburn.co.uk/settings&lt;/a> for me) and disabling &lt;code>Build pushed branches&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-3-2-deployment-methods-github-actions/travis-disable-build.png"
alt="Build pushed branches disabled on Travis"/> &lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Now that&amp;rsquo;s done, go ahead and check in your new GitHub Actions workflow file and then navigate to the &lt;code>Actions&lt;/code> tab of your source code repo on GitHub.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git add --all
git commit -m &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#39;Migrate to GitHub Actions&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
git push
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;figure>&lt;a href="github-actions-build.png">

alt="Successful build on GitHub Actions"/> &lt;/a>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Great success!&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Hopefully your build went to success! If it didn&amp;rsquo;t have a look through the logs and see what the issue was. It took me a few builds to determine my finalised workflow config. You can even see it at my &lt;a href="https://github.com/jdheyburn/jdheyburn.co.uk/actions">source code repo Actions page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve migrated across over to GitHub Actions, we can close out the permissions that TravisCI has on our projects, and demise any secret keys we gave it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the tone of my writing you can probably tell which one I favour. That&amp;rsquo;s not to say I do not like TravisCI - each service has its own pros and cons. For this particular project, I prefer the one platform approach for which I am used to in GitLab. The number of build minutes available for GA is a concern, but not one I will have to worry about for now.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Since &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/posts/who-goes-blogging-1-getting-started/">part 1&lt;/a>, we have been using a simple bash script called &lt;code>deploy.sh&lt;/code> to build our Hugo website and upload it to our GitHub Pages repo. In &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/posts/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/">part 2&lt;/a> we modified it slightly to include the &lt;code>CNAME&lt;/code> file post-build to ensure GitHub Pages uses the custom domain we set up in that same part.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this part, I will tell you about how I migrated from deploying via a script, to a CI/CD tool - namely &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.com/">TravisCI&lt;/a>. Then I will document how I migrated from this, to the new &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions&lt;/a>; GitHub&amp;rsquo;s offering into the CI/CD space.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;code>CI/CD&lt;/code> is an acronym for Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment which is a very important concept in the DevOps culture.

&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I had originally planned this to be one post, but it soon became far too long - and I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of taking in content in sizeable chunks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So this post will focus on migrating to TravisCI from the &lt;code>deploy.sh&lt;/code> script. Whereas the next post will focus on migrating to, and setting up GitHub Actions. If you&amp;rsquo;re only interested in using that as your CI tool then I&amp;rsquo;ll provide a link to that here when it is posted.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="moving-away-from-deploysh">Moving Away From deploy.sh&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s nothing necessarily wrong with using &lt;code>deploy.sh&lt;/code> to push our code, however we want to get all the bells and whistles that Continuous Integration can provide to us such as running a series of tests and checks automatically against every commit to our repository. Once those tests and checks pass then we can automate the deployment of our website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now there are many CI tools out there with the most well known likely to be &lt;a href="https://jenkins.io/">Jenkins&lt;/a>, but there are also hosted solutions available which will take your code and perform your pipelines against them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of those hosted solutions is &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.com/">TravisCI&lt;/a>, where they integrate quite nicely with GitHub repositories to attach &lt;a href="https://developer.github.com/webhooks/">webhooks&lt;/a> against them. They have several pricing options available, but for public open source projects, it is completely free!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it is a good idea to set your source code repository on GitHub to be public. TravisCI does include (at the time of writing) private projects in their free plan, but you are capped in some shape or form on how much the platform will do for you.&lt;/p>

alt="Screenshot of Travis free pricing plan"/> &lt;/a>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Free is definitely a thing you love to see&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="travisci-account-setup">TravisCI Account Setup&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The TravisCI account setup for TravisCI is very streamlined - instead of creating &lt;em>another&lt;/em> account for you to manage, it integrates in with GitHub, so this is the account you use to sign-up with. Head over to &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.com/">https://travis-ci.com/&lt;/a> and click on &lt;code>Sign in with GitHub&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="travis-landing.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-3-1-deployment-methods-travisci/travis-landing.png"
alt="Screenshot of Travis landing page"/> &lt;/a>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>You can&amp;rsquo;t resist a big green button&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>GitHub will ask you if you &lt;em>really&lt;/em> want to share some of your GitHub data with Travis.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">&lt;a href="travis-github-authorise.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-3-1-deployment-methods-travisci/travis-github-authorise.png"
alt="Screenshot of GitHub authorising Travis"/> &lt;/a>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Another green button? Why not!&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Once you&amp;rsquo;ve done that, you&amp;rsquo;ll be redirected to your new Travis Dashboard which&amp;hellip; is looking rather lonely 😦 - let&amp;rsquo;s fix that!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All we&amp;rsquo;ve done so far is allowed Travis to reach GitHub for creating an account for us - we now need to activate GitHub Apps integration to permit it to read and write to our repositories. The &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.com/account/repositories">https://travis-ci.com/account/repositories&lt;/a> page is what you need for that - then click on the &lt;code>Activate&lt;/code> button.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="travis-github-apps-integration.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-3-1-deployment-methods-travisci/travis-github-apps-integration.png"
alt="Screenshot of GitHub Apps Integration"/> &lt;/a>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;More green buttons?!&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Now on the next screen you may or may not want the default selection of &lt;code>All repositories&lt;/code> which will give Travis read and write access to all your repos. I completely trust Travis if I were to select this, however it is a best practice to follow the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">&lt;em>principle of least privilege&lt;/em>&lt;/a> (POLP); not just for users but for services too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the scope of this effort we&amp;rsquo;re only wanting Travis to read and manipulate against two repos, &lt;code>jdheyburn.co.uk&lt;/code> and &lt;code>jdheyburn.github.io&lt;/code> - it also gives you a cleaner Travis dashboard too.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">&lt;a href="travis-github-repos-selection.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-3-1-deployment-methods-travisci/travis-github-repos-selection.png"
alt="Screenshot of GitHub Travis Repository Authorisation"/> &lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h3 id="back-to-github">Back to GitHub&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The next step is required to permit Travis to push the built project to our GitHub Pages repo. We need to generate a secret with the permissions that Travis requires and keep it aside for the Travis config file later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Navigate to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">GitHub Personal Access Tokens&lt;/a> page and click on &lt;code>Generate new token&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ll come across a page asking for the name of the token being created. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what you call it, but it may be useful to link it back to what it is being used for. You&amp;rsquo;re also going to want to select the &lt;code>repo&lt;/code> checkbox as done so below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After this you don&amp;rsquo;t need to provide any more permissions to the token. Scroll down to the end of the page and click &lt;code>Generate token&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">&lt;a href="travis-github-pat.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-3-1-deployment-methods-travisci/travis-github-pat.png"
alt="Screenshot of GitHub Personal Access Token Creation - repos is checked"/> &lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The token&amp;rsquo;s secret will display on the next screen. &lt;strong>Make sure you copy it&lt;/strong> and place it somewhere you can refer back to it later such as a text editor like Notepad - we&amp;rsquo;ll need it again in the next section.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">&lt;a href="travis-github-pat-created.png">

alt="Screenshot of GitHub Personal Access Token Creation - token complete"/> &lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="travisci-configuration">TravisCI Configuration&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Once we have our Travis account set up, we need to add in a &lt;a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/">configuration file&lt;/a> that Travis will read from to determine what steps we&amp;rsquo;d like it to perform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our source code repository (&lt;code>jdheyburn.co.uk&lt;/code> in my case) we want to create a file at the root directory and call it &lt;code>.travis.yml&lt;/code>. See below for an example of how I configured mine.&lt;/p>
&lt;script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/jdheyburn/073bd6d4cb9284774e7e7feee093d86f.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s break it down section by section.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="build-environment">Build Environment&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>These settings here all refer to the build environment that we&amp;rsquo;d like our project to build on.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">dist&lt;/span>: xenial
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">git&lt;/span>:
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">depth&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">false&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">env&lt;/span>:
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">global&lt;/span>:
- HUGO_VERSION=&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;0.58.3&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">matrix&lt;/span>:
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">secure&lt;/span>: REDACTED
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>&lt;code>dist&lt;/code> specifies what platform Travis should build the project on. In this case &lt;code>xenial&lt;/code> refers to Ubuntu 16.04, which is a Linux distribution. There are &lt;a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/overview/">several others&lt;/a> to choose from and more likely than not you&amp;rsquo;ll want the platform to be Linux. However if you had a Windows application written in &lt;code>.NET&lt;/code> then you would likely want it built on a Windows Server since that is what supports it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>git.depth&lt;/code> tells Travis how many commits of your project to check out. This is passed directory to the &lt;code>git&lt;/code> parameter &lt;code>--depth&lt;/code> (more info on that &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone">here&lt;/a>). For our use case we&amp;rsquo;re not interested in this option so we set it to &lt;code>false&lt;/code> to disable the flag being passed to &lt;code>git&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>env.global&lt;/code> allows us to define what variables should be set in the environment. This is done in the form of an array of strings in the format &lt;code>key=value&lt;/code>. So given the example, &lt;code>HUGO_VERSION&lt;/code> will be set to &lt;code>0.58.3&lt;/code>. We&amp;rsquo;ll come back to this later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>env.matrix&lt;/code> is the encrypted value that gets passed to the &lt;code>GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/code> environment variable which is used to allow Travis to commit the built project to our GitHub Pages repo.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re going to want to take the personal access token generated from GitHub in the earlier step and encrypt it using &lt;a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables#encrypting-environment-variables">this method&lt;/a>, then add it back to this setting&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="external-dependencies">External Dependencies&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Once the build environment is defined, we can tell Travis to pull in some additional dependencies or files required for our project. Now remember this is a &lt;code>hugo&lt;/code> project and we needed to install it on our local machines to run &lt;code>deploy.sh&lt;/code>, we need to do the same for Travis too.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">install&lt;/span>:
- wget -q https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v${HUGO_VERSION}/hugo_extended_${HUGO_VERSION}_Linux-64bit.tar.gz
- tar xf hugo_extended_${HUGO_VERSION}_Linux-64bit.tar.gz
- mv hugo ~/bin/
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Remember we defined &lt;code>HUGO_VERSION&lt;/code> earlier? This is where it is called back again. In order, the steps we&amp;rsquo;re performing are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Downloading the archive containing the specified &lt;code>hugo&lt;/code> version&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Extracting all contents of the archive&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Moving the &lt;code>hugo&lt;/code> binary to the &lt;code>~/bin/&lt;/code> directory
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This directory is on the build servers &lt;code>PATH&lt;/code>, which enables us to execute the binary using just the &lt;code>hugo&lt;/code> command later&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h4 id="previous-issues">Previous Issues&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In a previous version of &lt;code>hugo&lt;/code> I used, there was an additional dependency I needed to include. The &lt;code>hugo-coder&lt;/code> theme requires to be built with Hugo Extended since it requires Sass/SCSS support.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this particular Hugo Extended version, it required a library which was not included in the build server distribution in the past. On the plus side - Travis allows us to define additional build steps to ensure all required libraries are on the build server beforehand.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">before_install&lt;/span>:
&lt;span style="color:#6272a4"># This workaround is required to avoid libstdc++ errors while running &amp;#34;extended&amp;#34; hugo with SASS support.&lt;/span>
- wget -q -O libstdc++&lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">6&lt;/span> http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/g/gcc&lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">-5&lt;/span>/libstdc++6_5&lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">.4.0&lt;/span>-6ubuntu1~&lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">16.04&lt;/span>.10_amd64.deb

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>However in later versions of Hugo (including the one I am using today) this dependency is no longer required, hence why it is commented out in &lt;code>.travis.yml&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may not need this stage in your pipeline, I know my project no longer requires it. However this may come in handy later knowing that you have the option of specifying more pipeline steps if the build distribution you&amp;rsquo;re using requires some additional dependencies.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="build-script">Build Script&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Now onto the juicy stuff - building the project. This is pretty much where the &lt;code>deploy.sh&lt;/code> starts from, since on our local machines we already had the &lt;code>hugo&lt;/code> binary installed.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">script&lt;/span>:
- hugo version
- hugo --gc --minify
- cp CNAME public/
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Not a lot is going on here, but to detail what each step is doing:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Print out the version of &lt;code>hugo&lt;/code> being used&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This is helpful for debugging the build. By printing out the version used we can try to replicate the bug locally for troubleshooting.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Build the project&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We do this with two flags, &lt;code>--gc&lt;/code> and &lt;code>--minify&lt;/code>. These weren&amp;rsquo;t defined in the &lt;code>deploy.sh&lt;/code> script we used earlier so let&amp;rsquo;s cover them here.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>--gc&lt;/code> tells &lt;code>hugo&lt;/code> to cleanup some unused cache files after the build
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This helps keep a tidy environment for the build server.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>--minify&lt;/code> performs &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)">minification&lt;/a> on your website to reduce the size of the generated content, enabling it to load faster on your users&amp;rsquo; devices
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Coupled with a CDN like in the &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/posts/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/#adding-our-cdn-layer">previous part&lt;/a>, your website will load almost instantly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Copy the &lt;code>CNAME&lt;/code> file from the project root to the generated &lt;code>public/&lt;/code> directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This ensures that the custom domain name we set up in the previous part continues to be set in the generated website code that gets pushed to our GitHub Pages repo. &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/posts/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/#building-into-our-deploy-script">See here&lt;/a> for a refresher.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This section is effectively the &amp;lsquo;CI&amp;rsquo; part of &amp;lsquo;CI/CD&amp;rsquo;. We could stop here and just use Travis as a build server to determine whether the website is able to be built successfully. Any errors in the pipeline would have resulted in a failed build.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next section details the Continuous Deployment, ensuring that on the successful build of a project we deploy it to our production environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="deploy-to-github-pages">Deploy to GitHub Pages&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Once the project has been built, we need to push it to the GitHub Pages repository. Travis has &lt;a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/">good documentation&lt;/a> on this. My setup follows the below:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">deploy&lt;/span>:
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">provider&lt;/span>: pages
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">skip-cleanup&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">true&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">github-token&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;$GITHUB_TOKEN&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">keep-history&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">true&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">local-dir&lt;/span>: public
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">repo&lt;/span>: jdheyburn/jdheyburn.github.io
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">target-branch&lt;/span>: master
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">verbose&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">true&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>For the last time, let&amp;rsquo;s walk through what each of these is doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>provider&lt;/code> tells Travis this is a GitHub Pages deployment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>skip-cleanup&lt;/code> set to &lt;code>true&lt;/code>, so that Travis does not delete the build before we&amp;rsquo;ve got the chance to upload it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>github-token&lt;/code> is set to the environment variable &lt;code>$GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/code> which was set for us earlier on in the build environment.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This is passed to the provider so that it has valid credentials to push the code to the GitHub Pages repo.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>keep-history&lt;/code> performs an incremental commit against the project
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Setting it to &lt;code>true&lt;/code> allows us to view back the changes in the commit history such as &lt;a href="https://github.com/jdheyburn/jdheyburn.github.io/commit/419da0cc71415d0253996b823d4ccf6844db4042">this one&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>local-dir&lt;/code> specifies the directory that should be pushed to the target repo
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We set it to &lt;code>public&lt;/code> because that is the name of the generated website directory from the previous &lt;code>script&lt;/code> step&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>repo&lt;/code> is the target repo where we should be deploying to&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>target-branch&lt;/code> is the branch that we want &lt;code>local-dir&lt;/code> to be pushed to
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For our setup we are using &lt;code>master&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>verbose&lt;/code> specifies how much detail Travis will log about its deploy activities&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>That concludes the configuration section. Remember to change it or add in some other functionality needed for your project and save it to &lt;code>.travis.yml&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="bringing-it-all-together">Bringing It All Together&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now you&amp;rsquo;ve completed your config file, let&amp;rsquo;s check it all in to GitHub.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git add --all
git commit -m &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#39;Adding CI&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
git push
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Travis will automatically detect that a new change has been made against your repo. And with the inclusion of &lt;code>.travis.yml&lt;/code>, it will now work against that file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can view the status of your repository&amp;rsquo;s build by navigating to it from the &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.com/dashboard">dashboard&lt;/a> and clicking on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If any of the commands in the &lt;code>script&lt;/code> section of the config return a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status#Shell_and_scripts">nonzero status code&lt;/a>, the build will fail. If this happens then have a look at a build log and investigate the issue. More likely than not someone else has encountered the problem before, so Google is your gatekeeper to solutions!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you&amp;rsquo;ve got a successful build, that means your website has been deployed to the GitHub Pages repo and will be available on the web to view. In a browser you can now view your changes on the website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If they aren&amp;rsquo;t there then your browser is most likely caching an older version. By default, websites served by GitHub Pages have a browser cache TTL &lt;a href="https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/119286/caching-assets-in-website-served-from-github-pages">set to 10 minutes&lt;/a>. So you can either wait 10 minutes, or clear your browser cache!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;re on the way to DevOps masterclass. As mentioned the next post will focus on migrating to GitHub Actions so if you&amp;rsquo;re happy with TravisCI then there&amp;rsquo;s no more you need to do! Go ahead and add other repositories you may have to Travis and build up multiple pipelines 🙌&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On Becoming An Open Source Software Contributor</title><enclosure url="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/on-becoming-an-open-source-software-contributor/terraform-aws.png" type="image/jpg"/><link>https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/on-becoming-an-open-source-software-contributor/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/on-becoming-an-open-source-software-contributor/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is going to be a relatively shorter post that&amp;rsquo;ll be in two parts since it&amp;rsquo;s more of a self-promotion&amp;hellip; But as of this Friday just gone, I finally had a &lt;a href="https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/pull/11388">pull request&lt;/a> approved to be merged to &lt;a href="https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws">terraform&amp;ndash;provider-aws&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Okay so it&amp;rsquo;s only a small piece of documentation, I&amp;rsquo;ve actually got another larger PR waiting to be merged in to the same project with new added functionality - and a bug fix in the pipeline too - which I hope to talk about in the future at some point. Although I can&amp;rsquo;t say I&amp;rsquo;m surprised this one got approved first - since it is by far the simplest change, and increased documentation is rarely a bad thing to add to a project.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="background">Background&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To talk a bit more about the context behind it, &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-patch-baselines.html">AWS SSM Patch Baselines&lt;/a> is used to define the rules of what patches should be installed on your EC2 instances.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For patch baselines tied to Linux instances, you can only define what patches should be installed &lt;em>at the OS level&lt;/em>. However for Windows instances - in addition to defining OS level patches - you can also define &lt;em>Microsoft application patches&lt;/em> to be installed too!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this can be done in the AWS Console easily enough, it is very common to define these resources as infrastructure-as-code (IaC), for which there are several to choose from. For my team we use &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io">Terraform&lt;/a> - and we wanted a way to be able to replicate the patch baselines we could create in the console into Terraform code too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After some digging I came across &lt;a href="https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/issues/8942">this issue&lt;/a> on &lt;code>terraform-provider-aws&lt;/code> that indicated the functionality was missing from the provider. When in fact the support had been there all along, since the AWS provider is merely a wrapper around &lt;a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go">aws-sdk-go&lt;/a> which calls the necessary APIs to create the resources. Where Terraform comes in is generating the dependency graphs for said resources and creating them in order asynchronously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you can see from the ticket, I was suggested to improve on the documentation - which leads us to where we are now. It is still pending release, however when it is out I&amp;rsquo;ll link it below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the meantime, let me talk about the importance of documentation in the next section.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="documentation-case-study">Documentation Case Study&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a sucker when it comes to documentation. Yes everyone talks about how important it is to include it not just open source projects but also in your day-to-day job. A whole lot of the time there is far too much knowledge-retention and not enough knowledge-sharing.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This reminds me of the character Brent from the novel &lt;a href="https://itrevolution.com/book/the-phoenix-project/">The Phoenix Project&lt;/a> - who doesn&amp;rsquo;t share a lot of the domain knowledge he experiences. FWIW I highly recommend the book!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In fact, documentation isn&amp;rsquo;t always necessarily for sharing knowledge with others, it is also about sharing knowledge &lt;em>with yourself&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What do I mean by that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Documenting down architecture, processes, runbooks, etc., can help to give you clarity into the subject you are writing about. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve extracted all the details and are able to view them at a high-level, you&amp;rsquo;re able to iron out any creases and make improvements from there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, more importantly, and one that is most beneficial to me is that&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>You will forget that shit and will need to reference it back again!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">&lt;a href="elephant-cartoon.png">

&lt;p>Not everyone can have the memory of an elephant&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>We are only human right? There is no way we can remember what most of us did a few weeks ago let alone a project from 6+ months ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="example">Example&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As an example of this a few years ago at a previous employer, I worked on a project to build a number of microservices that acted as an onboarding layer to integrate between internal corporate services (e.g. user entitlements, processes that user had access to, etc.) and &lt;a href="https://www.appdynamics.com/">AppDynamics&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I laid down all the flows, the design decisions, the architecture, the models, etc., on my documentation tool of choice (currently it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence&lt;/a>) as a place of reference should either my team, or myself need to refer back to it later on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few months later I took an internal move to another team within the same firm. In this new team I picked up a whole load of new information, of which there was no way I was able to retain everything all at once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Later on when my former teammates wanted to add an additional feature to the previous project, or wanted to troubleshoot a particular bug and wanted some context behind why things were operating the way that they were, they would reach out to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>At that point I directed myself and my former teammate to the documentation page for a refresher, and to let them know where they can go to solve the issue without me.&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without that documentation I guarantee that I would&amp;rsquo;ve spent a whole load more time on trying to recollect my thoughts, only to waste the time of my teammate. If there was an ongoing incident too, then the time to resolution would be hastened too.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t be that person to retain knowledge, it&amp;rsquo;ll end up coming round and biting you in the arse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After you&amp;rsquo;re done reading this, make a mental note to write down any process or piece of information you come across. Even if you&amp;rsquo;re doing a task or exercise for the first time, document your steps to how you got there - you&amp;rsquo;ll certainly need it in order to replicate the steps in future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Make a small start now that will make a big difference later on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Who Goes Blogging 2: Custom Domain</title><enclosure url="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/namecheap_landing.png" type="image/jpg"/><link>https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/posts/who-goes-blogging-1-getting-started/">previous post&lt;/a>, we got ourselves up and running with a website generated by Hugo, deployed to GitHub, and hosted by GitHub Pages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, we&amp;rsquo;re going to add a custom domain to our website so that we hide the &lt;code>&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;.github.io&lt;/code> domain that GitHub Pages is kindly hosting for us for free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the same time, we&amp;rsquo;re going to make our website blazingly fast for users by adding a caching layer with a content distribution network (CDN).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lastly, I&amp;rsquo;m going to throw in a bonus guide on how to redirect from multiple top-level domains (TLDs) to one (e.g. &lt;code>&amp;lt;your-domain&amp;gt;.com&lt;/code> redirects to &lt;code>&amp;lt;your-domain&amp;gt;.co.uk&lt;/code>).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s not much more to add from the last post. I talk a lot about domains and domain name system (DNS), which is the address-finder of the Internet, and an entirely huge beast in its own right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again - I won&amp;rsquo;t try to replicate already great guides out there on the topic. So if you&amp;rsquo;d like to find out more, see below for some helpful guides.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-dns-terminology-components-and-concepts">https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-dns-terminology-components-and-concepts&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="applying-a-custom-domain-to-github-pages">Applying a Custom Domain to GitHub Pages&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s add a degree of professionalism to our site by having a custom domain apply to it. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to make sure you own a domain first before you go ahead, so have a look at a few providers and see which works best for you &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/best-domain-registrars-in-2019">from a comparison list&lt;/a>. I bought mine from &lt;a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">namecheap&lt;/a> just because of the price and WhoisGuard features. There may be other providers that have the same features, so make sure to make your own comparison!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In the case of &lt;code>.co.uk&lt;/code> domains, because it is a UK domain that resides in the EU (for now), the WhoIS lookup is disabled by default - which is a huge win for privacy. WhoisGuard is available for non-EU domains and I highly recommend it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>GitHub has a &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">series of documentation&lt;/a> on applying a custom domain to GitHub Pages in much greater detail than what I am about to write out, should you wish to find out more information.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="acquire-a-domain">Acquire a Domain&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The rest of the post will depict a lot of Namecheap semantics, since that is the registrar I have access to. You can choose to follow the guide alongside a different registrar if you wish, at a high-level they will be pretty similar. For now, let&amp;rsquo;s move on ahead with Namecheap and navigate through to the &lt;a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">domain purchase page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="namecheap_landing.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/namecheap_landing.png"
alt="Screenshot depicting the namecheap domain landing page"/> &lt;/a>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>The hardest part is deciding on the domain name&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="namecheap-domain-purchase.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/namecheap-domain-purchase.png"
alt="Screenshot depicting the namecheap domain purchase page"/> &lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Once you&amp;rsquo;ve set up an account and purchased your domain, your accounts domain landing page will look something like the below.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="namecheap-domain-acquired.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/namecheap-domain-acquired.png"
alt="Screenshot depicting the namecheap domain landing page"/> &lt;/a>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Make sure you have auto-renew selected, otherwise you can kiss that domain goodbye when it expires!&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>When you purchase a domain from Namecheap, by default it will be pointing to their own domain name service (DNS) nameservers, as you can see from the picture above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This means when we type in our new domain into a browser, it will contact Namecheap for the IP address for that record.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently Namecheap is none the wiser about these records, which isn&amp;rsquo;t very exciting. Let&amp;rsquo;s move on to adding the CDN for the website.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="adding-our-cdn-layer">Adding Our CDN Layer&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As discussed in a &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/posts/who-goes-blogging-0-applying-cartography/#supercharge-your-delivery">previous post&lt;/a>, a CDN can provide us with many benefits. Go check out the page for a refresher of what those are and for why I selected Cloudflare. You can use whichever you like, however the remainder of this guide will focus on Cloudflare in particular - the concepts can still be applied at a high level to other CDNs.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Like with any introduction of an architectural component, a CDN has some drawbacks, such as making your service now dependent on a third party for which you have no control over. Namely Cloudflare in particular has had some high profile outages of recent date, but has been extremely reliable in my previous experiences with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You can go &lt;a href="https://blog.webnames.ca/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-a-content-delivery-network/">here&lt;/a> for a list of pros and cons of CDNs. Given this information I believe you can make your own mind up on what is best for yourself. For me, I the benefits far outweigh the downsides.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="cloudflare-our-domain">Cloudflare our Domain&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Create an account with &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare&lt;/a> if you haven&amp;rsquo;t done so already. Once done you&amp;rsquo;ll need to click &lt;strong>Add Site&lt;/strong> at the top of the browser dashboard. Enter your newly purchased domain from the previous section.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="cloudflare-add-domain.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/cloudflare-add-domain.png"
alt="Screenshot depicting the Cloudflare add domain page"/> &lt;/a>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Enter your newly purchased domain from the previous section&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Go ahead now and select the free plan, if you want to &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/plans/">go more advanced&lt;/a> then you can do so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once that&amp;rsquo;s created you&amp;rsquo;ll see Cloudflare scan the DNS records for this domain you&amp;rsquo;ve added - for now let&amp;rsquo;s navigate back to the &lt;a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Dashboard&lt;/a> and selecting the domain. You&amp;rsquo;ll be presented with a page similar to below, minus all the activity!&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="cloudflare-domain-landing.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/cloudflare-domain-landing.png"
alt="Screenshot depicting the Cloudflare domain home page"/> &lt;/a>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Name me a more iconic duo than numbers and graphs. I&amp;rsquo;ll wait&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h3 id="update-cloudflare-dns-records">Update Cloudflare DNS Records&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In order for Cloudflare to provide its benefits, it acts as the DNS server for your domain. This means that it will forward requests of our website to the IP addresses where our website is being hosted. It&amp;rsquo;s place in the topology is like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">1. Domain registrar ---&amp;gt; 2. DNS server and CDN provider ---&amp;gt; 3. Web server location
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Translated to our architecture:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">1. Namecheap ---&amp;gt; 2. Cloudflare ---&amp;gt; 3. GitHub Pages
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>What we need to do is instruct Cloudflare where to direct clients of the website. There are several ways of doing this, whether you want your website to be available at &lt;code>www.&amp;lt;your-domain&amp;gt;.co.uk&lt;/code> (CNAME record), or &lt;code>&amp;lt;your-domain&amp;gt;.co.uk&lt;/code> (APEX (A) record). Both of which are &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">well documented by GitHub&lt;/a> already. For the purpose of this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll guide you on my set up which is an ALIAS record.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Back to Cloudflare, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to load up the dashboard for your domain and navigate to the DNS icon in the taskbar at the top. Clicking on &lt;strong>Add record&lt;/strong> will allow you to add the A records that point to GitHub Pages&amp;rsquo;s IP addresses. As of writing (and &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain">documented&lt;/a>) they are:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">185.199.108.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.110.153
185.199.111.153
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s add these to the Cloudflare DNS page below.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="cloudflare-dns-record.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/cloudflare-dns-record.png"
alt="Screenshot depicting adding DNS records to Cloudflare"/> &lt;/a>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Add in the GitHub IP addresses one by one&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Once done - your records will look something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="cloudflare-completed-records.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/cloudflare-completed-records.png"
alt="Screenshot depicting completed DNS management"/> &lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ll notice an additional CNAME record at the bottom for &lt;code>www&lt;/code>. This will redirect any requests made to &lt;code>www.jdheyburn.co.uk&lt;/code> to &lt;code>jdheyburn.co.uk&lt;/code>. This could be something you&amp;rsquo;d want to replicate too if you wish.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing to note down before we move on is to capture the Cloudflare DNS Nameservers that have been assigned to our domain. You can find these on the same DNS management page we are on, but by just scrolling down we can see these nameservers.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="cloudflare-nameservers.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/cloudflare-nameservers.png"
alt="Screenshot depicting completed Cloudflare DNS nameservers"/> &lt;/a>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Make a note of these nameservers for your domain&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h3 id="direct-namecheap-to-cloudflare">Direct Namecheap to Cloudflare&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/posts/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/#acquire-a-domain">Earlier in this post&lt;/a>, I mentioned that a newly created Namecheap domain will default to their own DNS nameservers. We want to change this to Cloudflares DNS nameservers from which we configured our DNS records.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Navigate to the &lt;a href="https://ap.www.namecheap.com/domains/list/">Namecheap management page&lt;/a> for your domain and enter the Cloudflare nameservers once you have selected &lt;strong>Custom DNS&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">&lt;a href="namecheap-nameservers.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/namecheap-nameservers.png"
alt="Screenshot depicting completed nameservers pointing to Cloudflare"/> &lt;/a>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Add in your Cloudflare domains from previously&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Once this is done you may need to wait a while for the DNS updates to propagate throughout the world. While we&amp;rsquo;re waiting for that, there&amp;rsquo;s one final piece of the puzzle which can keep us busy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="github-pages-configuration">GitHub Pages Configuration&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The last place to configure is GitHub Pages. Currently it is hosting at our &lt;code>.github.io&lt;/code> domain, but we need to instruct it to redirect to our custom domain. There are two methods for doing this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Configure the repository settings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use a &lt;code>CNAME&lt;/code> file in your repository&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h4 id="configure-the-repository-settings">Configure the repository settings&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This is the quicker of the two solutions, so I advise to follow this step to understand if you have everything in place correctly. Once done then you can lock-in your changes with step 2 above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this step, you need to navigate to the settings pages for your &lt;code>.github.io&lt;/code> repo containing your rendered code.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">https://github.com/&amp;lt;USERNAME&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;USERNAME&amp;gt;.github.io/settings
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now scroll down, keep going until you hit the &lt;strong>GitHub Pages&lt;/strong> heading. Here you will see a form for entering a custom domain; do the honours and enter it in like below.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="github_pages_setup.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/github_pages_setup.png"
alt="Screenshot depicting GitHub Pages form for specifying a custom domain"/> &lt;/a>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Ignore my already published domain&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Now again wait for DNS to propagate across the world. When GitHub is happy with the changes then you will see the green banner similar to the one in the screenshot above. This means everything is being served up! Why not give it a try ourselves? Head to your domain now and see if everything is working!&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="jdheyburn_co_uk_custom_domain.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/jdheyburn_co_uk_custom_domain.png"
alt="Screenshot depicting completed custom domain"/> &lt;/a>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>You should end up with something like this!&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h4 id="solidying-our-changes-with-a-cname-file">Solidying our changes with a CNAME file&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>We can use the above method to quickly try using GitHub repository settings to see if everything is working, however I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of setting changes in code (Infrastructure-as-code anyone?). GitHub supports another method which is to use a file named &lt;code>CNAME&lt;/code> in our generated &lt;code>.github.io&lt;/code> repo that contains the domain name we wish to use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my case, I would have the following&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#6272a4"># CNAME&lt;/span>
jdheyburn.co.uk
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This then tells a repo that is enabled for GitHub Pages to use the domain in this file as our custom domain, effectively producing the steps in the previous section. Neato.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The change to implement this is fairly easy. I have to admit I picked it up from somewhere but I don&amp;rsquo;t have the source to reference it to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So back in your &lt;code>blog-source&lt;/code> repo, you want to execute the below, replacing the template with your domain.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">echo&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;&amp;lt;DOMAIN-NAME&amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span> &amp;gt; CNAME
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h4 id="building-into-our-deploy-script">Building into our deploy script&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Once that is done, you will need to modify your &lt;code>deploy.sh&lt;/code> script to copy over the file into your generated Hugo site, because Hugo won&amp;rsquo;t do it for you! Don&amp;rsquo;t have the deploy script or need a refresher? Head back to the &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/posts/who-goes-blogging-1-getting-started/#bash-script-deploying">previous post&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will want to copy it after Hugo has done its thing, take a look at the Gist below - line 9 is your friend.&lt;/p>
&lt;script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/jdheyburn/e84bab9176dc1753416637324a04603d.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>What this is doing is taking the &lt;code>CNAME&lt;/code> file that already exists in our &lt;code>blog-source&lt;/code> repo and moving it to the generated &lt;code>public/&lt;/code> directory which Hugo created for us. It is then this &lt;code>public/&lt;/code> directory that gets committed to the GitHub Pages repo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then that&amp;rsquo;s it! Take a look at my &lt;a href="https://github.com/jdheyburn/jdheyburn.github.io">finished repo&lt;/a> and you&amp;rsquo;ll see where &lt;code>CNAME&lt;/code> fits in.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="bonus-tld-redirection">Bonus: TLD Redirection&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let me tell you a story. Your website is up and operational. You&amp;rsquo;re super proud of it, and you give yourself a round of applause 👏&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be the only person looking at it, you want the whole world to! You tell your parents, your significant other, the dog off the street - they all remember the name of your website, but &lt;em>was it at &lt;code>.com&lt;/code> or &lt;code>.&amp;lt;insert snazzy TLD here&amp;gt;&lt;/code>&lt;/em>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, you domain isn&amp;rsquo;t at &lt;code>.com&lt;/code>, that&amp;rsquo;s boring as hell! You just forked out $50 on a &lt;code>.dev&lt;/code> TLD, and no one will see it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily there is a way&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can buy additional domains at different TLDs and have them redirect to your &lt;em>one-domain-to-rule-them-all&lt;/em> with little to no hassle! There is the cost of purchasing the domain and renewing it year after year, but with that being ~£10 or so per year - I&amp;rsquo;d call that a good insurance policy to ensure people land at your website!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my case, I purchased &lt;code>jdheyburn.com&lt;/code> and had it redirect to &lt;code>jdheyburn.co.uk&lt;/code> - why not give it a try: &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.com">https://jdheyburn.com&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The steps are already defined in this post. For a breakdown of what they are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/#acquire-a-domain">Purchase a domain&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/#cloudflare-our-domain">Create a new website in Cloudflare&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/#update-cloudflare-dns-records">Create a DNS A record to redirect to your correct domain&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/#direct-namecheap-to-cloudflare">Configure Namecheap to use Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s nameservers&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Steps 1 and 2 are pretty easy to perform yourselves - so for this exercise I&amp;rsquo;ll join in at step 3.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cloudflare-domain-redirection">Cloudflare Domain Redirection&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Assuming that you&amp;rsquo;ve completed steps 1 and 2, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to configure the redirection - but we don&amp;rsquo;t do this via inserting a DNS record like we did previously, Cloudflare has a feature that handles that for us called &lt;strong>Page Rules&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On your Cloudflare website landing page, navigate to &lt;strong>Page Rules&lt;/strong> in the toolbar at the top and then &lt;strong>Create Page Rule&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="cloudflare_page_rules.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/cloudflare_page_rules.png"
alt="Screenshot depicting how to access the Create Page Rule feature"/> &lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>In the next screen we&amp;rsquo;re going to define the rule. Cloudflare have &lt;a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/categories/200276257-Page-Rules">documentation on Page Rules&lt;/a>, and even more &lt;a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200172286-Configuring-URL-forwarding-or-redirects-with-Cloudflare-Page-Rules">specifically on redirection&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From this screen you will want something that appears as below.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="cloudflare_new_page_rule.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/cloudflare_new_page_rule.png"
alt="Screenshot depicting how to populate the Create Page Rule form"/> &lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s break down what&amp;rsquo;s happening here:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>We define a pattern of &lt;code>*jdheyburn.com/*&lt;/code>, indicating that the rule is active should a URL be queried to Cloudflare&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This pattern will match any request at this domain&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Next comes the rule action, which is:&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Set this URL as a forwarding URL - to reply back to the client with &lt;code>301 Permanent Redirect&lt;/code> status code&lt;/li>
&lt;li>With the forwarded URL being &lt;code>https://jdheyburn.co.uk/$2&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>/$2&lt;/code> at the end of the rule is crucial here. This will carry across any URL path parameters or query parameters to the redirected URL. In fact &lt;code>$2&lt;/code> refers to anything that matches the second asterisk (&lt;code>*&lt;/code>) in the rule pattern (&lt;code>*jdheyburn.com/*&lt;/code>). So &lt;code>https://jdheyburn.com/contact&lt;/code> will redirect to &lt;code>https://jdheyburn.co.uk/contact&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Having the forwarded URL set to the &lt;code>https://&lt;/code> scheme will ensure that your users will receive your website encrypted, safe from man-in-the-middle attacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Lastly, click on &lt;strong>Save and Deploy&lt;/strong> to finalise your changes; you&amp;rsquo;ll have a view such as below.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="cloudflare_completed_page_rule.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-2-custom-domain/cloudflare_completed_page_rule.png"
alt="Screenshot depicting the newly created page rule"/> &lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s all you need - once again you will have to wait for DNS replication to trickle down. You can repeat this over again for other domains you may have.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>That it for this part, we covered quite a lot of things:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Purchasing a custom domain&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Applying a CDN cache layer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>HTTPS redirection&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Redirect multiple domains to one location&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Next up I&amp;rsquo;ll document the various deployment methods I have used for the website.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Who Goes Blogging 1: Getting Started</title><enclosure url="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-1-getting-started/local_example_site.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><link>https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-1-getting-started/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-1-getting-started/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot of talking about how this website is currently, but let&amp;rsquo;s talk about how you can get set up with the same as I have done here. Let&amp;rsquo;s recap exactly what that is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>A GitHub repo with the site source code&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Another GitHub project with the rendered site&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hosted on GitHub Pages&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fronted by a custom domain&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Globally cached by a CDN&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Redirecting multiple domains&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll cover the first three points in this post, with the remainder to come in a follow up post.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pre-requisites--assumptions">Pre-requisites &amp;amp; Assumptions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>These series of posts is aimed at between the newcomer, to intermediate programmer. There may be some concepts which I won&amp;rsquo;t be covering to due brevity, and because there are several guides out there who have explained these concepts better than I could.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having said that, I assume you are comfortable with the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Navigating your way through a terminal&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Happy with the basic set of &lt;code>git&lt;/code> commands&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Understand how website requests are made (though this isn&amp;rsquo;t crucial)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="hugo-static-site-builder">Hugo Static Site Builder&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are many website building platforms out there for your static sites. There is no one platform to rule them all, you should decide on which one works best for you. For myself, I wanted to explore further into the realm of Golang as a learning opportunity. I&amp;rsquo;ve built websites from scratch before from basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all the way to using frameworks such as React and Angular.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However while using these frameworks provide you with the highest flexibility in terms of customisability, they can take a while to get something out there and hosted, when really you just want something to generate the HTML and CSS for you and allow you to focus on the content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s where static site frameworks come in. They usually have some opinionated folder structure and some nuances on how things in a website should be, but comply by these rules and the website will be generated for you! Once such example is &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a> - which is what this website is built on; it&amp;rsquo;s opensource and written in Golang, you can even check out the &lt;a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo">source code&lt;/a> to see how it works!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>While Hugo itself is free and comes with a bunch of &lt;a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">themes&lt;/a> you can use for free, there are fancier and more feature-rich themes available to purchase from designers which may have a cost attached to them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Hugo isn&amp;rsquo;t the only static site framework out there, there are plenty more too each with their own pros and cons. I won&amp;rsquo;t aim to reproduce a complete list of comparisons against other platforms, other people have already made the comparisons much better than I could! But nevertheless, some that I am aware of off the top of my head are &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost&lt;/a>, and the infamous &lt;a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress&lt;/a> - so investigate using your search engine of choice if you wish to know the differences.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>UPDATE 2019-11-30&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I came across &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21616149">this thread&lt;/a> on HackerNews which ultimately lead me to these comparison websites for static site generators:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">https://www.staticgen.com/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://staticsitegenerators.net/">https://staticsitegenerators.net/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>All set on Hugo? Awesome - let&amp;rsquo;s get started on some project foundations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="git-set-up">Git Set Up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I mentioned before I split my website into two repos:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/jdheyburn/jdheyburn.co.uk">jdheyburn.co.uk&lt;/a> holds all the source code&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/jdheyburn/jdheyburn.github.io">jdheyburn.github.io&lt;/a> holds the rendered website&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For the first repo, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter what you call it - you can call it your destined domain name, or &lt;code>blog-source&lt;/code>, or &lt;code>dogs-are-great&lt;/code>. It&amp;rsquo;s the second one which you will need to think about, where it must be &lt;code>&amp;lt;YOUR_USERNAME&amp;gt;.github.io&lt;/code> - which will ultimately be made available at &lt;code>https://&amp;lt;YOUR_USERNAME&amp;gt;.github.io&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Create two &lt;a href="https://github.com/new">empty Github repos now&lt;/a>, then clone both to your environment. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have git available in your terminal, check out &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git">this guide&lt;/a> to get set up.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mkdir ~/projects
&lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">cd&lt;/span> projects
git clone https://github.com/&amp;lt;USERNAME&amp;gt;/blog-source.git
git clone https://github.com/&amp;lt;USERNAME&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;USERNAME&amp;gt;.github.io.git
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now that we have the repos set up, let&amp;rsquo;s get started on building the website templates.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="blog-bootstrapping">Blog Bootstrapping&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before you get started, you&amp;rsquo;re going to need to install Hugo - head to &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing">this page&lt;/a> for instructions on going so. Once done continue on below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Firstly you would need to create your Hugo template. You can do this from either executing &lt;code>hugo new &amp;lt;site|theme&amp;gt;&lt;/code> and building up from there - or do what I did which was to browse the &lt;a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">Hugo themes&lt;/a> and &lt;code>git clone&lt;/code> the example site for the chosen theme and then make your changes around that. It may entirely depend on your learning approach which way works best for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my case, I wanted to get up and running in the smallest time possible (isn&amp;rsquo;t that the point of static site generators?), so I followed the approach above.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="serves-up">Serves Up!&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The theme this blog uses as of publication is &lt;a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-coder/">hugo-coder&lt;/a>, written by &lt;a href="https://luizdepra.dev/">Luiz de Prá&lt;/a>. You may wish to use it, or something else. It&amp;rsquo;s entirely up to you! Let&amp;rsquo;s get started by laying down the foundations and cloning the theme.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">cd&lt;/span> ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder.git
cp -r hugo-coder/exampleSite blog-source
mkdir blog-source/themes
ln -s ~/projects/hugo-coder blog-source/themes/hugo-coder
&lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">cd&lt;/span> blog-source
hugo serve
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>That last command will locally serve the example site, so that you can view it at &lt;code>http://localhost:1313/&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="local_example_site.jpg">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-1-getting-started/local_example_site.jpg"
alt="Screenshot depicting the locally run example site"/> &lt;/a>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Success!&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h3 id="experimenting">Experimenting&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Once you have the site hosted locally, feel free to make as many changes as you like to gain an understanding of how everything plugs together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>blog-template/config.toml&lt;/code> file will contain the majority of configurations that are used to generate the site. Go ahead and even comment out some config and see what affect that has. You can even &lt;a href="https://github.com/jdheyburn/jdheyburn.co.uk/blob/master/config.toml">be nosey at my config file&lt;/a> if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for some inspiration! The &lt;code>hugo serve&lt;/code> command will watch all files in the directory for any changes you make, rebuild them, and refresh your webpage too with the changes - making for hasty development!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Hugo config file will be a source of many informations, and the &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/">documentation for it is very thorough&lt;/a>. While we&amp;rsquo;re on the subject, the rest of the Hugo documentation is great, so check the rest of it out if you haven&amp;rsquo;t done so already - particularly how the &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/">directories are structured&lt;/a>, and how &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/">content is managed&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I advise you now go off and explore all the customisation options for your site, when you&amp;rsquo;re ready to have it deployed, continue on reading.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="theme-git-submodules">Theme Git Submodules&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When we were setting up the &lt;code>exampleSite&lt;/code> locally, we created a symlink from &lt;code>~/projects/blog-source/themes/hugo-coder&lt;/code> -&amp;gt; &lt;code>~/projects/hugo-coder&lt;/code>. This is okay for local development, however not particularly the best practice in the real world. We want to take an existing git repo (hugo-coder) and apply that to a directory in our project, but what we &lt;em>don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em> want to do is duplicate the code in our own repo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This problem is solved exactly by &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">&lt;strong>git submodules&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, and we define it within the &lt;code>.gitmodules&lt;/code> file of our source code repo.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#6272a4"># .gitmodules&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">[&lt;/span>submodule &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;themes/hugo-coder&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">]&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">path&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span> themes/hugo-coder
&lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">url&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span> https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder.git
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now when this file is checked into the repo, any future clones will also include the hugo theme as a submodule in the &lt;code>themes/hugo-coder&lt;/code> directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you&amp;rsquo;ve done this, your source code is all set! Why not share it with the rest of the world?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="releasing-into-the-wild">Releasing into the wild&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So far we have only been playing with the &lt;code>hugo serve&lt;/code> command, which is great for local development but not for production. There is a more appropriate command for building hugo projects - aptly named &lt;code>hugo&lt;/code>; pretty simple right?&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">hugo
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This renders the HTML and CSS files from your config and markdown for the theme and places them in the &lt;code>public/&lt;/code> directory of your source code repo. In theory once you&amp;rsquo;ve executed this command you can host a webserver at that address and everything would operate as normal. Why not give it a try?&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">cd&lt;/span> public/
python -m SimpleHTTPServer &lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">8080&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>We can even go one step further by adding flags to the &lt;code>hugo&lt;/code> command, such as &lt;code>--minify&lt;/code> which will minimalise all the supported files into a much smaller size, resulting in faster load times for your users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since we are still in our source code repo, we want to make sure that &lt;code>public/&lt;/code> directory doesn&amp;rsquo;t get included in future commits. This is because the &lt;code>blog-source&lt;/code> repo should be entirely for source code, our other repo is the one that holds the rendered code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this we can utilise a &lt;code>.gitignore&lt;/code> file, instructing git to ignore any files that match the terms in the contents. Let&amp;rsquo;s get one created now and check our code into the repo.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">echo&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;public/\nresources/&amp;#34;&lt;/span> &amp;gt; .gitignore
git add .
git commit -m &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#39;Initial commit&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
git push
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re currently committing to one repo, however we want GitHub Pages to host it for us. As mentioned earlier, GP can only host repos at the domain &lt;code>github.io&lt;/code>, so we need to get our rendered website into that repo.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="bash-script-deploying">Bash Script Deploying&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Now the original way I did this was through a simple bash script which largely followed &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#step-by-step-instructions">this process&lt;/a> as documented by the Hugo team. Note that this is largely the process we have followed thus far, with the exception of step 6 onwards - so ensure you follow those steps.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve since moved over onto a CI/CD platform which I will discuss in a future post.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>After following the process in the link prior, you should be able to invoke your deploy script at &lt;code>./deploy.sh&lt;/code>, which will push the built &lt;code>public/&lt;/code> directory to your &lt;code>&amp;lt;USERNAME&amp;gt;.github.io&lt;/code>. GitHub should pick up that this is a GitHub Pages repo and have your site ready for you at &lt;code>https://&amp;lt;USERNAME&amp;gt;.github.io&lt;/code>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this post, we have done the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Created two GitHub repos:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>one for storing the source code for the website&lt;/li>
&lt;li>another containing the rendered web pages&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Built Hugo locally for development using &lt;code>hugo serve&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Written a script for deployment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deployed to GitHub Pages&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Next up, we&amp;rsquo;ll be adding a custom domain to the site, front it with a CDN, and redirect multiple domains to it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Who Goes Blogging 0: Applying Cartography</title><enclosure url="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-0-applying-cartography/blog-arch-cover.png" type="image/jpg"/><link>https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-0-applying-cartography/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-0-applying-cartography/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="applying-cartography">Applying Cartography&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With my academic background focused in infrastructure, I love seeing diagrams of topologies - they&amp;rsquo;re a pretty damn useful way of understanding architecture of an application flow amongst other things. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at how my portfolio site is architected out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I mentioned in my &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/posts/blog-bootstrap/">first blog post&lt;/a> - I&amp;rsquo;ve got several ideas on how I can improve on the architecture of this site. But what good is evaluating where you&amp;rsquo;ve come from if you don&amp;rsquo;t document what you currently have?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s when you can make true comparisons in any system. As such the aim of this series of posts will be to explain how this website is architected, so that we may reference it in future posts. Later on, I&amp;rsquo;ll also talk about how you&amp;rsquo;re able to get yourself set up as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-setup">The Setup&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Because we all love an architecture diagram, let&amp;rsquo;s slap one in now.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="blog-arch-cover.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-0-applying-cartography/blog-arch-cover.png"
alt="An architecture diagram of my portfolio site"/> &lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Wow. That is&amp;hellip; really not much at all. Apologies if you were expecting a lot more arrows and boxes!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a way, I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be sorry, because one of the core priniciples in software development is KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid!) - and this setup is just an advantage of how I decided the first implementation of my website to be:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Easy to implement&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Easy to maintain (there is none required!)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a firm believer that you&amp;rsquo;re best off getting a minimum viable product out there ASAP and then work to perfect it afterward. What I hope to document as time goes on are the various enhancements and changes that I intend on making to the website so that yourselves can follow along too with your own site. That goes not just for this site (how much can it really be improved?!) but for whatever projects I work on.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="so-what-does-it-all-mean">So what does it all mean?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Back to the diagram, let&amp;rsquo;s follow it from right-to-left and start talking about what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="github-pages---somewhere-to-call-home">GitHub Pages - somewhere to call home&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You can see that the site is hosted on GitHub Pages. Essentially this is GitHub&amp;rsquo;s platform for hosting the static resources that are checked into the public repos. This then presents the assets at a domain prefix of your choosing, suffixed by &lt;code>.github.io&lt;/code> - in my case it is at &lt;code>jdheyburn.github.io&lt;/code>. GitHub Pages only hosts your site via HTTPS so you know your pages aren&amp;rsquo;t being subject to a man-in-the-middle attack, and it takes care of your TLS certificates so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about renewing them!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You might be wondering why you would need to serve a static site over HTTPS when you aren&amp;rsquo;t handling anything confidential. I&amp;rsquo;ll turn you to Troy Hunt&amp;rsquo;s excellent article &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-why-your-static-website-needs-https/">Here&amp;rsquo;s Why Your Static Website Needs HTTPS&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="supercharge-your-delivery">Supercharge your delivery!&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Now that the website is hosted at GitHub - I stuck a content delivery network (CDN) in front of GitHub for a whole load of reasons, some of which are:&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="fast-end-user-response-times">Fast end-user response times&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>CDNs cache your content at edge locations dotted all over the globe, where the client is then served content from the one closest geographically (let me direct you to &lt;a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~rcs/research/interactive_latency.html">latency numbers every programmer should know&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="security">Security&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The CDN acts as a proxy between the client and your servers - their requests don&amp;rsquo;t actually hit you directly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not only that, a lot of CDNs provide DDoS protection to ensure excessive requests don&amp;rsquo;t bring down your servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="analytics">Analytics&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Because everyone loves graphs and numbers&amp;hellip; right??&amp;hellip; Alright just me then&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ll be able to see how many requests are being served up, where requests originate from, amongst others. Take a look at an example below.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="analytics_example.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/who-goes-blogging-0-applying-cartography/analytics_example.png"
alt="A graph displaying total requests, and how many of them were cached"/> &lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h4 id="custom-domain">Custom domain&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This means you can access your site on something other than &lt;code>&amp;lt;my_site&amp;gt;.github.io&lt;/code>, which is great for when you move off GitHub Pages to another platform, you can just tell Cloudflare to source requests from another server&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It also gives your site that extra polish and professionalism about it - wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you agree?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>My CDN of choice is &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare&lt;/a>, for no reason more than is it completely free to use and will most likely stay free until I decide I would benefit from the next &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/plans/">pricing step&lt;/a>. Did I mention the website is pretty damn easy to use as well?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That means that the operating cost of a site like this is exactly ZILCH (nada, et al.), which again is another great reason to get set up on a platform like this.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="top-level-domain-fatigue">Top-level domain fatigue?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m from the UK - and I wanted my site to reflect that, so I purchased a domain with the top-level domain (TLD) &lt;code>.co.uk&lt;/code>. However when users come to visit me on my site they may not always remember whether it was &lt;code>.com&lt;/code>, &lt;code>.dev&lt;/code>, &lt;code>.tk&lt;/code> (remember those?). Therefore I also have &lt;code>jdheyburn.com&lt;/code> set up in the same way as its &lt;code>.co.uk&lt;/code> sibling to maximise that user experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Okay well that means there is a slight cost to maintain the site through purchasing and renewing the custom domains (notice how jdheyburn.com redirects to jdheyburn.co.uk?) but we&amp;rsquo;re talking in the £10s per year for these two.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in having a setup like this, then over the next few posts I&amp;rsquo;ll be detailing how you can do the same.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on a side project that I&amp;rsquo;ve written in Python. Now I&amp;rsquo;ve have a lot of experience with Python before, I used it primarily to write a load of scripts for automating processes for when Bash didn&amp;rsquo;t quite cut it. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong Bash is great, but like for every other language out there, each has its purpose in the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My experience with Python didn&amp;rsquo;t go beyond setting some variables, hitting endpoints, executing some Bash commands to install some vendor components. All of which is what makes Python so great right? Implying on types is useful for some cases. In fact this reminds me of a tweet I saw, I can&amp;rsquo;t find it again but it went something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Stages of learning programming:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Learn a typed language, such as Java - complain at its complexity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Learn an untyped language, such as JavaScript or Python - marvel at its simplicity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Get frustrated at implied types in step 2&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Revert to step 1&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>During said experiences I came across some poorly written scripts whiched &lt;strong>triggered&lt;/strong> some pet peeves: what object a function is expecting, or what it returns? Did I break some downstream function? This made it terribly difficult to add new functionality to scripts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With this side project I wanted to make it right from the start. So I said to myself these are the key areas I want to target:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The application must be extensively tested (did I mention I &lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/posts/extending-gotests-for-strict-error-tests/">love tests?&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Functions must clearly define what the type of the objects the parameters are, and what the types of the objects they return are.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;del>Best&lt;/del> Practices are upheld throughout the way&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>From this list, we can include the following to solve the above:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/three-ways-to-spice-up-your-python-code/#tests">Tests!!&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/three-ways-to-spice-up-your-python-code/#static-type-checking">Static type checking&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/three-ways-to-spice-up-your-python-code/#class-objects">Classes&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="tests">Tests&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Alright so I know this one is a given. But in all honesty I&amp;rsquo;ve never really tested Python code before. Why so? I found it difficult to mock API calls and the effort required for the initial learning curve didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to pay off for the tiny script I was automating. Given the scope of my side project is rather large, this is a great opportunity to learn. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a basic function:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#6272a4"># scratch.py&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">def&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">increment_int_by_one&lt;/span>(int_to_inc):
incremented_int &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span> int_to_increment &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">+&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">1&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">return&lt;/span> incremented_int
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>While this is something easy enough to test by doing so manually, at some point its functionality may increase, and at that point we would require automated tests to ensure its original feature-set was unchanged.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="implementation">Implementation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There are &lt;a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonTestingToolsTaxonomy">several testing frameworks&lt;/a> out there, but for my use case I am using the built-in &lt;code>unittest&lt;/code> which is easy enough to use. A basic structure of a test file is seen below:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#6272a4"># test_scratch.py&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">import&lt;/span> unittest
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">import&lt;/span> scratch
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">TestIncrement&lt;/span>(unittest&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">.&lt;/span>TestCase):
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">def&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">test_increment&lt;/span>(self):
&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c"> Should successfully return int value 2
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c"> Given a parameter of int value 1
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c"> &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
expected &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">2&lt;/span>
int_to_inc &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">1&lt;/span>
actual &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span> scratch&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">.&lt;/span>increment_int_by_one(int_to_inc)
self&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">.&lt;/span>assertEqual(actual, expected)
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">if&lt;/span> __name__ &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">==&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#39;__main__&amp;#39;&lt;/span>:
unittest&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">.&lt;/span>main()
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot going on here, let&amp;rsquo;s break it down by section.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="imports">Imports&lt;/h4>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">import&lt;/span> unittest
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">import&lt;/span> scratch
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here we are specifying the modules that the test file is going to interact with. &lt;code>unittest&lt;/code> is the testing framework and &lt;code>scratch&lt;/code> is the Python file containing our business logic, as written earlier.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="class-declaration">Class Declaration&lt;/h4>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">TestIncrement&lt;/span>(unittest&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">.&lt;/span>TestCase):
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Simply enough, this is a class that extends the &lt;code>unittest.TestCase&lt;/code> class, for which then unittest can then execute all the test methods defined within it, and you can name them like &lt;code>class TestXXXX&lt;/code>. There is no limit to how many classes you can have, but I like to group my TestClasses together in terms of what logic they are testing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="test-methods">Test Methods&lt;/h4>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">def&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">test_increment&lt;/span>(self):
&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c"> Should successfully return int value 2
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c"> Given a parameter of int value 1
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c"> &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
expected &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">2&lt;/span>
int_to_inc &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">1&lt;/span>
actual &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span> scratch&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">.&lt;/span>increment_int_by_one(int_to_inc)
self&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">.&lt;/span>assertEqual(actual, expected)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>These methods are the real juicy bits of your tests. Here you are defining the parameters that are going to be used by your functions, and hitting the logic you are testing. For each test that you write you will alter the test name, description, expected values, and input parameters accordingly to what you are testing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="main-method-invocation">Main Method Invocation&lt;/h4>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">if&lt;/span> __name__ &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">==&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#39;__main__&amp;#39;&lt;/span>:
unittest&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">.&lt;/span>main()
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>To close off nice and easily, this will tell Python to invoke all test classes that are described within &lt;code>unittest.TestCase&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="execution">Execution&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Now just execute the test file and it will now run as expected:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">&amp;gt;&lt;/span> python &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">-&lt;/span>m unittest test_scratch

OK
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>A nice little touch is that we don&amp;rsquo;t even need to provide &lt;code>-m unittest&lt;/code> to the Python intepreter since we have defined the main method invocation:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">&amp;gt;&lt;/span> python test_scratch&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">.&lt;/span>py

Ran &lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">1&lt;/span> test &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">in&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">0.002&lt;/span>s
OK
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="static-type-checking">Static Type Checking&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As I mentioned before, Python is great for throwing together a script to automate some task. It&amp;rsquo;s quick and easy to do mainly because the type of a variable is implied from whatever you set to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span> my_int_var &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">1&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">type&lt;/span>(my_int_var)
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">&amp;lt;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">class&lt;/span> &amp;#39;&lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">int&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This also applies to functions that take in a parameter, the type for it is implied from what it receives! Let&amp;rsquo;s revisit our incrementing function from earlier:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">def&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">increment_int_by_one&lt;/span>(int_to_inc):
incremented_int &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span> int_to_increment &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">+&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">1&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">return&lt;/span> incremented_int
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">print&lt;/span>(increment_int_by_one(&lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">1&lt;/span>))
&lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">2&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">print&lt;/span>(increment_int_by_one(&lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">100&lt;/span>))
&lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">101&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>All good so far. But what happens when we pass in something that is not an int, such as a string?&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">print&lt;/span>(increment_int_by_one(&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;1&amp;#34;&lt;/span>))
Traceback (most recent call last):
File &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, line &lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">1&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">in&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">&amp;lt;&lt;/span>module&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">&amp;gt;&lt;/span>

TypeError: must be &lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">str&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">not&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">int&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Yikes, that&amp;rsquo;s a misleading error! Having a look at the error straight away, you&amp;rsquo;d be confused at &amp;lsquo;what&amp;rsquo; must be a string, not an int - didn&amp;rsquo;t you accidentally provide a str? So why is it telling us it must be a str and not an int?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What this is actually error-ing on is how an int is being concatenated to a str on the left-hand side of the + operator.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Under the hood, Python believe you are trying to do a &lt;strong>string concatenation&lt;/strong> because the parameter is of type string, and is on the left-hand side of the + operator. The below shows a valid way to perform a string concatenation:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; + &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; # -&amp;gt; &amp;quot;11&amp;quot;&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the int value was on the left-hand side of the operator and you passed a string, you&amp;rsquo;d get something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1 + &amp;#34;1&amp;#34;
Traceback (most recent call last):
File &amp;#34;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;#34;, line 1, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: &amp;#39;int&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;str&amp;#39;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>But changing the right-side of the operator won&amp;rsquo;t fix this for us. What we need is to implement typing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="implementation-1">Implementation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Python 3.6 onwards introduced static type checking, so make sure you upgrade to it if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already - which you might want to do very soon as Python 2 is &lt;a href="https://pythonclock.org/">EOL in 2020&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Taking our above &lt;code>increment_int_by_one&lt;/code> function, we can add &lt;code>: int&lt;/code> to the parameter which will tell the function what type it expects the parameter to be.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">def&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">increment_int_by_one&lt;/span>(int_to_inc: &lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">int&lt;/span>):
incremented_int &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span> int_to_increment &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">+&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">1&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">return&lt;/span> incremented_int
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now when we pass in a &lt;code>str&lt;/code> as the parameter, we still get the same error we saw before. However, if the IDE you are using supports it, you will receive &lt;strong>type hints&lt;/strong>!&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">&lt;a href="type_hinting.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/three-ways-to-spice-up-your-python-code/type_hinting.png"
alt="Screenshot displaying type hinting provided by Visual Studio Code"/> &lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m using VSCode with the Python extension installed too, you can see the hint that appears includes the type of the parameter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VSCode also has the ability to check the type of the value you are passing into the function:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">&lt;a href="type_checking.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/three-ways-to-spice-up-your-python-code/type_checking.png"
alt="Screenshot displaying type checking provided by Visual Studio Code - the illegal type is highlighted by pyright"/> &lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Here we have a visual indicator that the string is incompatible with the int type of the function. Alongside this, in the Problems tab we have a full explanation on what has gone wrong. This is both provided by the &lt;code>pyright&lt;/code> extension which can be found in the VSCode Extensions section.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="return-types">Return Types&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>So all of that just describes how typing works for parameters, but how can we specify the return type of a function? That is done easily enough too. Let&amp;rsquo;s extend on our increment function from earlier.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">def&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">increment_int_by_one&lt;/span>(int_to_inc: &lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">int&lt;/span>) &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">-&amp;gt;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">int&lt;/span>:
incremented_int &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span> int_to_inc &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">+&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">1&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">return&lt;/span> incremented_int
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Note the only change here is the &lt;code>-&amp;gt; int&lt;/code> which specifies the type it is returning. Now our type checker will highlight to us when we violate this in two scenarios:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">&lt;a href="type_checking_bad_return.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/three-ways-to-spice-up-your-python-code/type_checking_bad_return.png"
alt="Screenshot displaying type checking, highlighting the bad return value"/> &lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The IDE has shown us that the function is expected to return a type different to what it is actually returning&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="center">&lt;a href="type_checking_bad_assign.png">
&lt;img src="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/three-ways-to-spice-up-your-python-code/type_checking_bad_assign.png"
alt="Screenshot displaying type checking, highlighting the bad assigned variable"/> &lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>And in this snapshot, we are trying to assign a variable of type &lt;code>str&lt;/code> to the output of the function which returns an &lt;code>int&lt;/code>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another pattern you might see is if a method does not return anything (in Java-speak, it is &lt;code>void&lt;/code>), an example of this is if the method is a constructor for a class.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">def&lt;/span> __init__(self) &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">-&amp;gt;&lt;/span> None:
self&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">.&lt;/span>attribute &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#39;DEFAULT_VALUE&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="class-objects">Class Objects&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So you might &lt;strong>class&lt;/strong> this (pardon the pun!) as a type of its own, but this is something I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt all the same recently, so I hope it benefits you too! Python has the ability to construct more complex objects in the form of classes. While I won&amp;rsquo;t go into the details of that (I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it up to &lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp">better resources&lt;/a>), I wanted to show how I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to utilise them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="test-mocks">Test Mocks&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One of the main reasons for implementing classes has been to resolve one of my requirements I described earlier on in this post, the ability to test my code easily. For my side project I interface with some third-party APIs to retrieve data, in order for me to test these I need to mock them appropriately. See below for a snippet of the code:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#6272a4"># spotify.py&lt;/span>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>You might have guessed it, the API is Spotify&amp;rsquo;s, and I am using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/plamere/spotipy">spotipy&lt;/a> library to do the interfacing. The &lt;code>SpApi&lt;/code> class is essentially a wrapper around the client to allow me to easily re-use methods across the app. It&amp;rsquo;s usage would be &lt;code>sp_api = SpApi()&lt;/code>, which would return us a client available at &lt;code>sp_api.client&lt;/code>. It is this attribute of the class which we want the ability to mock for when we test it. See how I implemented the mock:&lt;/p>

self&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">.&lt;/span>assertEqual(actual, expected)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Talking about &lt;code>get_mock_sp_api&lt;/code> first, this constructs a new &lt;code>SpApi&lt;/code> wrapper class, but then it overwrites the client attribute with MagicMocks from the unittest framework. MagicMock essentially creates a mocked object or function for you. When I create a MagicMock with a &lt;code>return_value&lt;/code> parameter, it will return that passed parameter when the MagicMock object is invoked.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Did you notice how it specifies the return type too?! &lt;code>-&amp;gt; spotify.SpApi&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The test &lt;code>test_get_album_by_id&lt;/code> creates an instance of this mocked Spotify API, so when we call the wrapper method &lt;code>get_album_by_id&lt;/code> it makes a downstream call to &lt;code>client.album&lt;/code>, which is what we mocked already with the chained MagicMock object! So now we can tell it what to return back when hit with certain parameters - and validating back with &lt;code>assert_called_once_with&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Trying to learn how to implement the above has probably been the biggest blocker for me to test Python code in this way - now that I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered it I can&amp;rsquo;t stop using it everywhere!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="complex-object-comparison">Complex Object Comparison&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Much like the previous section, this relates to the static typing we implemented earlier. I was writing methods that returned complex objects encapsulated in classes, and I wanted to be able to test for equality using unittest&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>self.assertEqual(actual, expected)&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s take this simple class:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">SomeObject&lt;/span>():
some_str: &lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">str&lt;/span>
some_int: &lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">int&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">def&lt;/span> __init__(self, some_str: &lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">str&lt;/span>, some_int: &lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">int&lt;/span>) &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">-&amp;gt;&lt;/span> None:
self&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">.&lt;/span>some_str &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span> some_str
self&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">.&lt;/span>some_int &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span> some_int
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>What we want to achieve is for us to be able to use the below test like so:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">TestObject&lt;/span>(unittest&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">.&lt;/span>TestCase):

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This fails because we have not overwritten the default &lt;code>__eq__&lt;/code> method on the class. Python then defaults to comparing the memory references for both objects. Since these are two entirely different objects they will be pointing to different memory references. What we need to do is tell Python what defines equality, so let&amp;rsquo;s add the method onto &lt;code>SomeObject&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>And here we are! First we are quickly checking to see the two objects are of the same type before we proceed with the underlying values (fail first, and early!). From there we are checking the attributes within the objects. Hurrah!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One neat little trick I like to do for complex objects that have multiple attributes, is that instead of writing out a new &lt;code>and&lt;/code> comparator for every attribute, is to replace it all with this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">def&lt;/span> __eq__(self, other):

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The &lt;code>__dict__&lt;/code> attribute returns the objects in a Python dictionary format, which will contain all the attributes and their values. If the objects are entirely identical then they will return true! Now let&amp;rsquo;s run the test again.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I love confirming the stability of my code through writing tests and practicing Test-driven development (TDD). For Java, JUnit was my preferred testing framework of choice. When writing tests to confirm an exception had been thrown, I used the optional parameter &lt;code>expected&lt;/code> for the annotation &lt;code>@Test&lt;/code>, however I quickly found that this solution would not work for methods where I raised the same exception class multiple times for different error messages, and testing on those messages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is commonly found in writing a validation method such as the one below, which will take in a name of a dog and return a boolean if it is valid.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-java" data-lang="java">&lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">static&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#8be9fd">boolean&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">validateDogName&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">(&lt;/span>String dogName&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">)&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">throws&lt;/span> DogValidationException &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">{&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">if&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">(&lt;/span>containsSymbols&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">(&lt;/span>dogName&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">))&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">{&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">throw&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">new&lt;/span> DogValidationException&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;Dogs cannot have symbols in their name!&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">);&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">}&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">if&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">(&lt;/span>dogName&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">.&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">length&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">&amp;gt;&lt;/span> 100&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">)&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">{&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">throw&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">new&lt;/span> DogValidationException&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;Who has a name for a dog that long?!&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">);&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">}&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">return&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">true&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">;&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">}&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>For this method, just using &lt;code>@Test(expected = DogValidationException.class)&lt;/code> on our test method is not sufficient; how can we determine that the exception was raised for a dogName.length breach and not for containing symbols?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order for me to resolve this, I came across the &lt;code>ExpectedException&lt;/code> class for JUnit on &lt;a href="https://www.baeldung.com/junit-assert-exception">Baeldung&lt;/a> which enables us to specify the error message expected. Here it is applied to the test case for this method:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-java" data-lang="java">@Rule

@Test
&lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#8be9fd">void&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">shouldHandleDogNameWithSymbols&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">()&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">{&lt;/span>
exceptionRule&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">.&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">expect&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">(&lt;/span>DogValidationException&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">.&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">class&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">);&lt;/span>
exceptionRule&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">.&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">expectMessage&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;Dogs cannot have symbols in their name!&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">);&lt;/span>

&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">}&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="applying-to-golang">Applying to Golang&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Back to Golang, there is a built-in library aptly named &lt;code>testing&lt;/code> which enables us to assert on test conditions. When combined with &lt;a href="https://github.com/cweill/gotests">Gotests&lt;/a> - a tool for generating Go tests from your code - writing tests could not be easier! I love how this is bundled in with the Go extension for VSCode, my text editor of choice (for now&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Converting the above Java &lt;code>validateDogName&lt;/code> method to Golang will produce something like:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-golang" data-lang="golang">&lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">func&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">validateDogName&lt;/span>(name &lt;span style="color:#8be9fd">string&lt;/span>) (&lt;span style="color:#8be9fd">bool&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#8be9fd">error&lt;/span>) {
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">if&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">containsSymbols&lt;/span>(name) {
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">return&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">false&lt;/span>, errors.&lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">New&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;dog cannot have symbols in their name&amp;#34;&lt;/span>)
}
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">if&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">len&lt;/span>(name) &amp;gt; &lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">100&lt;/span> {
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">return&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">false&lt;/span>, errors.&lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">New&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#f1fa8c">&amp;#34;who has a name for a dog that long&amp;#34;&lt;/span>)
}
&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">return&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">true&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">nil&lt;/span>
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If you have a Go method that returns the &lt;code>error&lt;/code> interface, then gotests will generate a test that look like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-golang" data-lang="golang">&lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">func&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">Test_validateDogName&lt;/span>(t &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">*&lt;/span>testing.T) {

})
}
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>From the above we are limited to what error we can assert for, here &lt;em>any&lt;/em> error returned will pass the test. This is equivalent to using &lt;code>@Test(expected=Exception.class)&lt;/code> in JUnit! But there is another way&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We only need to make a few simple changes to the generated test to give us the ability to assert on test error message&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

})
}
}&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>From the above there are three highlighted changes, let&amp;rsquo;s go over them individually:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;code>wantErr error&lt;/code>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>we are changing this from &lt;code>bool&lt;/code> so that we can make a comparison against the error returned from the function&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>wantErr: errors.New(&amp;quot;dog cannot have symbols in their name&amp;quot;),&lt;/code>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>this is the error struct that we are expecting&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>if tt.wantErr != nil &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !reflect.DeepEqual(err, tt.wantErr) {&lt;/code>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>check to make sure the test is expected an error, if so then compare it against the returned error&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Point 3 provides additional support if there was a test case that did not expect an error. Note how &lt;code>wantErr&lt;/code> is omitted entirely from the test case below.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-golang" data-lang="golang">{

},
want: &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">true&lt;/span>,
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="customising-gotests-generated-test">Customising Gotests Generated Test&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Gotests gives us the ability to provide our own templates for generating tests, and can easily be integrated into your text editor of choice. I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how this can be done in VSCode.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Check out gotests and copy the templates directory to a place of your choosing
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>git clone https://github.com/cweill/gotests.git&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>cp -R gotests/internal/render/templates ~/scratch/gotests&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Overwrite the contents of function.tmpl with &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/jdheyburn/978e7b84dc9c197bcdd41afece2edab5">the contents of this Gist&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the following setting to VSCode&amp;rsquo;s settings.json
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>&amp;quot;go.generateTestsFlags&amp;quot;: [&amp;quot;--template_dir=~/scratch/templates&amp;quot;]&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Once you have done that, future tests will now generate with stricter error testing! 🎉&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="closing">Closing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I understand that the recommendations above will make your code more fragile, as the code is subject to any changing of the error message of say a downstream library. However for myself, I prefer to write tests that are strict and minimalise the chance of other errors contaminating tests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also understand that GoodestBoy#1 is probably a valid name for a dog! 🐶&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog Bootstrap</title><enclosure url="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/images/jdheyburn_co_uk_card.png" type="image/jpg"/><link>https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/blog-bootstrap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/blog-bootstrap/</guid><description>&lt;p>Howdy! 👋&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This site will be an area for me to braindump everything and anything that comes across my mind - although I&amp;rsquo;ll try my best to keep it tech-focused!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The blog platform itself is pretty basic. It is built using &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a>, hosted using &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages&lt;/a>, while served over a custom domain via CloudFlare. While this isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly anything to brag about, it is only meant to be a quick and easy platform to spin up and get hosted so that I can focus on what really matters&amp;hellip; the content!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It also gives me an opportunity to migrate the platform from GitHub Pages onto another hosted platform. Maybe that is AWS, which is a perfect learning opportunity, or even customise the theme of this blog (which is very cool already - thanks &lt;a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-coder/">hugo-coder!&lt;/a>) that I have left as its default. All of which provides me with more content to blog about!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See you around!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
